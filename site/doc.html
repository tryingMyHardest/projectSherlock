&lt;title&gt;A STUDY IN SCARLET&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;part num="I"&gt;
&lt;partTitle&gt;Being a reprint from the Reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D.,
 Late of the Army Medical Department.
&lt;/partTitle&gt;



&lt;chapter id="1" num="I"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course
prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,
I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant
Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I
could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at
Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and
was already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many
other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded
in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once
entered upon my new duties.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and
attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of
Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which
shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have
fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the
devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a
pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to
the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved
so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little
upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse
of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and
when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak
and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be
lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in
the troopship "Orontes," and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty,
with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a
paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to
improve it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as
air—or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will
permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to
London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of
the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a
private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless
existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely
than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I
soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate
somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in
my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making
up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less
pretentious and less expensive domicile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at
the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning
round I recognized young &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt;, who had been a dresser under me at
Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London
is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt; had
never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with
enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In
the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn,
and we started off together in a hansom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;Whatever have you been doing with yourself, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked in
undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it
by the time that we reached our destination.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;Poor devil!&lt;/quote&gt; he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my
misfortunes. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;What are you up to now?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Looking for lodgings,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Trying to solve the problem as to
whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;That’s a strange thing,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked my companion; &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;you are the second
man to-day that has used that expression to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And who was the first?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.
He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone
to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which
were too much for his purse.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;By Jove!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;if he really wants someone to share the rooms and
the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a
partner to being alone.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt; looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;You
don’t know &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; yet,&lt;/quote&gt; he said; &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;perhaps you would not care
for him as a constant companion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why, what is there against him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer
in his ideas—an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I
know he is a decent fellow enough.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;A medical student, I suppose?&lt;/quote&gt; said I.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;No—I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well
up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,
he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are
very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the
way knowledge which would astonish his professors.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Did you never ask him what he was going in for?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I should like to meet him,&lt;/quote&gt; I said. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;If I am to lodge with anyone, I
should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong
enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in
Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How
could I meet this friend of yours?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;He is sure to be at the laboratory,&lt;/quote&gt; returned my companion. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;He either
avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to
night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Certainly,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other
channels.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt;
gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to
take as a fellow-lodger.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,&lt;/quote&gt; he said; &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;I know
nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally
in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold
me responsible.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It
seems to me, &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; I added, looking hard at my companion, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that
you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this
fellow’s temper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed
about it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;It is not easy to express the inexpressible,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered with a
laugh. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; is a little too scientific for my tastes—it approaches
to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch
of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you
understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an
accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would
take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion
for definite and exact knowledge.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Very right too.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the
subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking
rather a bizarre shape.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Beating the subjects!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him
at it with my own eyes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And yet you say he is not a medical student?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are,
and you must form your own impressions about him.&lt;/quote&gt; As he spoke, we
turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which
opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,
and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and
made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall
and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage
branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.
Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,
test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.
There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant
table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round
and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;I’ve found it! I’ve
found it,&lt;/quote&gt; he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a
test-tube in his hand. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;I have found a re-agent which is precipitated
by hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.&lt;/quote&gt; Had he discovered a gold mine,
greater delight could not have shone upon his features.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt;, introducing us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How are you?&lt;/quote&gt; he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for
which I should hardly have given him credit. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have been in
Afghanistan, I perceive.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How on earth did you know that?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked in astonishment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Never mind,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, chuckling to himself. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The question now is about
hæmoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of
mine?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;but
practically——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
Don’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.
Come over here now!&lt;/quote&gt; He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness,
and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Let us
have some fresh blood,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger,
and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You
perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water.
The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no
doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic
reaction.&lt;/quote&gt; As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals,
and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the
contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was
precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ha! ha!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a
child with a new toy. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you think of that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It seems to be a very delicate test,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and
uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The
latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this
appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test
been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who
would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Indeed!&lt;/quote&gt; I murmured.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His
linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon
them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit
stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an
expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his
heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his
imagination.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You are to be congratulated,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked, considerably surprised at
his enthusiasm.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would
certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there
was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of
Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases
in which it would have been decisive.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt; with a
laugh. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police
News of the Past.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very interesting reading it might be made, too,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have to be careful,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, turning to me with a smile, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;for
I dabble with poisons a good deal.&lt;/quote&gt; He held out his hand as he spoke,
and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of
plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;We came here on business,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt;, sitting down on a high
three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his
foot. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were
complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought
that I had better bring you together.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with
me. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;which would
suit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,
I hope?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally
do experiments. Would that annoy you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;By no means.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at
times, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am
sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What
have you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the
worst of one another before they begin to live together.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed at this cross-examination. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I keep a bull pup,&lt;/quote&gt; I said, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;and
I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all
sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of
vices when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked,
anxiously.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It depends on the player,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;A well-played violin is a
treat for the gods—a badly-played one——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, that’s all right,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, with a merry laugh. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think we may
consider the thing as settled—that is, if the rooms are agreeable to
you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;When shall we see them?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle
everything,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;All right—noon exactly,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, shaking his hand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards
my hotel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;By the way,&lt;/quote&gt; I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt;,
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;That’s just his little
peculiarity,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;A good many people have wanted to know how he
finds things out.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Oh! a mystery is it?&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, rubbing my hands. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;This is very
piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper
study of mankind is man,’ you know.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;You must study him, then,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt; said, as he bade me good-bye.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Stamford"&gt;You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more
about you than you about him. Good-bye.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Good-bye,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
interested in my new acquaintance.
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="2" num="II"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.
221B, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They
consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy
sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad
windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate
did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was
concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That
very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the
following morning &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; followed me with several boxes and
portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and
laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually
began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new
surroundings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in
his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up
after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out
before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the
chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and
occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest
portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working
fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for
days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly
uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these
occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes,
that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some
narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life
forbidden such a notion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his
aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and
appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual
observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively
lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and
piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have
alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air
of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and
squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were
invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was
possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had
occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile
philosophical instruments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how
much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to
break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned
himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how
objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my
attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather
was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me
and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these
circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my
companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,
confirmed &lt;person perName="Stamford"&gt;Stamford&lt;/person&gt;’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to
have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in
science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance
into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was
remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so
extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly
astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise
information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers
are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man
burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason
for doing so.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary
literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to
nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way
who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax,
however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the
Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any
civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware
that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an
extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You appear to be astonished,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, smiling at my expression of
surprise. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;To forget it!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You see,&lt;/quote&gt; he explained, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I consider that a man’s brain originally is
like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture
as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he
comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets
crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so
that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful
workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his
brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in
doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the
most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has
elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes
a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that
you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to
have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But the Solar System!&lt;/quote&gt; I protested.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What the deuce is it to me?&lt;/quote&gt; he interrupted impatiently; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;you say that
we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a
pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something
in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I
pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw
my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which
did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he
possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own
mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was
exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.
I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It
ran in this way—
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SHERLOCK HOLMES—his limits.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. Knowledge of Literature.—Nil.
2. Philosophy.—Nil.
3. Astronomy.—Nil.
4. Politics.—Feeble.
5. Botany.—Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons
generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.
6. Geology.—Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils
from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers,
and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he
had received them.
7. Chemistry.—Profound.
8. Anatomy.—Accurate, but unsystematic.
9. Sensational Literature.—Immense. He appears to know every detail of
every horror perpetrated in the century.
10. Plays the violin well.
11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.
12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all
these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,&lt;/quote&gt;
I said to myself, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I may as well give up the attempt at once.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These
were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other
accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I
knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s
Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would
seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in
his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape
carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes
the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were
fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which
possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether
the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I
could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos
had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick
succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation
for the trial upon my patience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think
that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,
however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most
different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,
dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, and who came
three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,
fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same
afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew
pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely
followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old
white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on
another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these
nondescript individuals put in an appearance, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; used to
beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.
He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I
have to use this room as a place of business,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;and these
people are my clients.&lt;/quote&gt; Again I had an opportunity of asking him a
point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing
another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some
strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by
coming round to the subject of his own accord.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I
rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had
not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed
to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee
prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell
and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a
magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it,
while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles
had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye
through it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its somewhat ambitious title was "The Book of Life," and it attempted
to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and
systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as
being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The
reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to
be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary
expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a
man’s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility
in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions
were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling
would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the
processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him
as a necromancer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;From a drop of water,&lt;/quote&gt; said the writer, &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;a logician could infer the
possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of
one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is
known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,
the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired
by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal
to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to
those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest
difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary
problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to
distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to
which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the
faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to
look for. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by
his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by
his expression, by his shirt cuffs—by each of these things a man’s
calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten
the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What ineffable twaddle!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, slapping the magazine down on the
table, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I never read such rubbish in my life.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What is it?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why, this article,&lt;/quote&gt; I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat
down to my breakfast. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I see that you have read it since you have
marked it. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me
though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who
evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own
study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a
third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades
of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against
him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You would lose your money,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; remarked calmly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;As for
the article I wrote it myself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The
theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so
chimerical are really extremely practical—so practical that I depend
upon them for my bread and cheese.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And how?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked involuntarily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the
world. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.
Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of
private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I
manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before
me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history
of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance
about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your
finger ends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first.
&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently
over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And these other people?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all
people who are in trouble about something, and want a little
enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and
then I pocket my fee.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But do you mean to say,&lt;/quote&gt; I said, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that without leaving your room you
can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although
they have seen every detail for themselves?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case
turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about
and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special
knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters
wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which
aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation
with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you,
on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You were told, no doubt.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long
habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I
arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate
steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran,
‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military
man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics,
for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for
his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his
haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it
in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English
army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in
Afghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I
then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is simple enough as you explain it,&lt;/quote&gt; I said, smiling. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You remind
me of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did
exist outside of stories.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; rose and lit his pipe. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No doubt you think that you are
complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,&lt;/quote&gt; he observed. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, in my
opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of
breaking in on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a
quarter of an hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He
had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a
phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Have you read Gaboriau’s works?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Does Lecoq come up to your
idea of a detective?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sniffed sardonically. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Lecoq was a miserable bungler,&lt;/quote&gt;
he said, in an angry voice; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;he had only one thing to recommend him,
and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question
was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in
twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a
text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired
treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood
looking out into the busy street. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;This fellow may be very clever,&lt;/quote&gt; I
said to myself, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;but he is certainly very conceited.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,&lt;/quote&gt; he said,
querulously. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What is the use of having brains in our profession. I
know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or
has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural
talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the
result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling
villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard
official can see through it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought
it best to change the topic.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I wonder what that fellow is looking for?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked, pointing to a
stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the
other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a
large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a
message.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Brag and bounce!&lt;/quote&gt; thought I to myself. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;He knows that I cannot verify
his guess.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were
watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across
the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps
ascending the stair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;For &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, stepping into the room and handing
my friend the letter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little
thought of this when he made that random shot. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;May I ask, my lad,&lt;/quote&gt; I
said, in the blandest voice, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;what your trade may be?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Commissionaire, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, gruffly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Uniform away for repairs.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And you were?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my
companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,
sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was
gone.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="3" num="III"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;THE LAURISTON GARDENS MYSTERY&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the
practical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers
of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking
suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged
episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could
have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he
had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,
lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How in the world did you deduce that?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Deduce what?&lt;/quote&gt; said he, petulantly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have no time for trifles,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered, brusquely; then with a
smile, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but
perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that
man was a sergeant of Marines?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;No, indeed.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were
asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some
difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the
street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the
fellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,
however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was
a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.
You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his
cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of
him—all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Wonderful!&lt;/quote&gt; I ejaculated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Commonplace,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, though I thought from his expression that
he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I said just now
that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong—look at this!&lt;/quote&gt;
He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why,&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, as I cast my eye over it, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;this is terrible!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It does seem to be a little out of the common,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, calmly.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Would you mind reading it to me aloud?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the letter which I read to him—
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston
Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there
about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected
that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front
room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman,
well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of ‘&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch
J. Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There had been no robbery, nor is
there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of
blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a
loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair
is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before
twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_
until I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you
fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would
favour me with your opinion.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours faithfully,
  &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;TOBIAS GREGSON.&lt;/person&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,&lt;/quote&gt; my friend remarked;
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;he and &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and
energetic, but conventional—shockingly so. They have their knives into
one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional
beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put
upon the scent.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Surely there is
not a moment to be lost,&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;shall I go and order you a cab?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy
devil that ever stood in shoe leather—that is, when the fit is on me,
for I can be spry enough at times.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the
whole matter, you may be sure that &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, and Co. will
pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But he begs you to help him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but
he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.
However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my
own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that
an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Get your hat,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You wish me to come?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, if you have nothing better to do.&lt;/quote&gt; A minute later we were both in
a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the
house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets
beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away
about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an
Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the
melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,&lt;/quote&gt; I said at
last, interrupting &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ musical disquisition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No data yet,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a capital mistake to theorize before
you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You will have your data soon,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked, pointing with my finger;
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much
mistaken.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So it is. Stop, driver, stop!&lt;/quote&gt; We were still a hundred yards or so
from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our
journey upon foot.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It
was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two
being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of
vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here
and there a "To Let" card had developed like a cataract upon the
bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption
of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and
was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting
apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very
sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was
bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the
top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable,
surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and
strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the
proceedings within.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had imagined that &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; would at once have hurried into the
house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be
further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the
circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up
and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the
opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,
he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass
which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice
he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an
exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon
the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going
over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn
anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the
quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he
could see a great deal which was hidden from me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,
flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and
wrung my companion’s hand with effusion. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;It is indeed kind of you to
come,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I have had everything left untouched.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Except that!&lt;/quote&gt; my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If a herd
of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No
doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, before you
permitted this.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I have had so much to do inside the house,&lt;/quote&gt; the detective said
evasively. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;My colleague, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, is here. I had relied upon him
to look after this.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;With two
such men as yourself and &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; upon the ground, there will not be
much for a third party to find out,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I think we have done
all that can be done,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered; &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;it’s a queer case though, and I
knew your taste for such things.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You did not come here in a cab?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;No, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nor &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;No, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then let us go and look at the room.&lt;/quote&gt; With which inconsequent remark
he strode on into the house, followed by &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, whose features
expressed his astonishment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and
offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One
of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged
to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious
affair had occurred. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; walked in, and I followed him with that
subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of
all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was
blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had
become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.
Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of
imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a
red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was
hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was
intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole
apartment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was
centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon
the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured
ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of
age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and
a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat
and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and
cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor
beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while
his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been
a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,
and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human
features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low
forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a
singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his
writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never
has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy
apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban
London.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway,
and greeted my companion and myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;This case will make a stir, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;It beats anything I
have seen, and I am no chicken.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;There is no clue?&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;None at all,&lt;/quote&gt; chimed in &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it
intently. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are sure that there is no wound?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked, pointing to
numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Positive!&lt;/quote&gt; cried both detectives.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual—presumably
the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the
circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the
year ‘34. Do you remember the case, &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;No, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Read it up—you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It
has all been done before.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and
everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes
wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.
So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed
the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the
dead man’s lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather
boots.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He has not been moved at all?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You can take him to the mortuary now,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is nothing more
to be learned.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered
the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised
him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; grabbed
it up and stared at it with mystified eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;There’s been a woman here,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered
round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of
plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;This complicates matters,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Heaven knows, they were
complicated enough before.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?&lt;/quote&gt; observed &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There’s
nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his
pockets?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;We have it all here,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, pointing to a litter of objects
upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;A gold watch, No. 97163,
by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold
ring, with masonic device. Gold pin—bull-dog’s head, with rubies as
eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch J. Drebber&lt;/person&gt; of
Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse,
but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition
of Boccaccio’s _Decameron_, with name of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Joseph Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; upon the
fly-leaf. Two letters—one addressed to &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;E. J. Drebber&lt;/person&gt; and one to &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Joseph
Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;At what address?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;American Exchange, Strand—to be left till called for. They are both
from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their
boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about
to return to New York.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you made any inquiries as to this man, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I did it at once, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I have had advertisements sent
to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American
Exchange, but he has not returned yet.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you sent to Cleveland?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;We telegraphed this morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How did you word your inquiries?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad
of any information which could help us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to
be crucial?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I asked about &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case
appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I have said all I have to say,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, in an offended voice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make
some remark, when &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, who had been in the front room while we
were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,
rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have just made a discovery of the highest
importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a
careful examination of the walls.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a
state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his
colleague.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Come here,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of
which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, stand
there!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Look at that!&lt;/quote&gt; he said, triumphantly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this
particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a
yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was
scrawled in blood-red letters a single word—
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RACHE.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you think of that?&lt;/quote&gt; cried the detective, with the air of a
showman exhibiting his show. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This was overlooked because it was in the
darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The
murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where
it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide
anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See
that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was
lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion
of the wall.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; in
a depreciatory voice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name
Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark
my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a
woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for
you to laugh, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. You may be very smart and clever,
but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I really beg your pardon!&lt;/quote&gt; said my companion, who had ruffled the
little man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You
certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,
and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the
other participant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to
examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying
glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly
about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once
lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that
he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to
himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of
exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of
encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded
of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and
forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes
across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his
researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between
marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying
his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one
place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the
floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his
glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the
most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he
replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,&lt;/quote&gt; he
remarked with a smile. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply
to detective work.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; had watched the manœuvres of their amateur
companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently
failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ smallest actions were all directed towards some
definite and practical end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;What do you think of it, sir?&lt;/quote&gt; they both asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume
to help you,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked my friend. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are doing so well now that it
would be a pity for anyone to interfere.&lt;/quote&gt; There was a world of sarcasm
in his voice as he spoke. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If you will let me know how your
investigations go,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I shall be happy to give you any
help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who
found the body. Can you give me his name and address?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; glanced at his note-book. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;John Rance,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;He is off
duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; took a note of the address.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Come along, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; he said; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell
you one thing which may help you in the case,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, turning to
the two detectives. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There has been murder done, and the murderer was a
man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had
small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a
Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,
which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his
off fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and
the finger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only
a few indications, but they may assist you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;If this man was murdered, how was it done?&lt;/quote&gt; asked the former.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Poison,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; curtly, and strode off. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One other
thing, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he added, turning round at the door: &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘Rache,’ is the
German for ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals
open-mouthed behind him.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="4" num="IV"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt; led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a
long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us
to the address given us by &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is nothing like first hand evidence,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;as a matter
of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as
well learn all that is to be learned.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You amaze me, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said I. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Surely you are not as sure as you
pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There’s no room for a mistake,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The very first thing
which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts
with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had
no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep
impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks
of the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more
clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new
shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there
at any time during the morning—I have &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;’s word for that—it
follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore,
that it brought those two individuals to the house.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That seems simple enough,&lt;/quote&gt; said I; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;but how about the other man’s
height?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from
the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though
there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride
both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of
checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct
leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing
was just over six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And his age?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest
effort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth
of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.
Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.
There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary
life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I
advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,&lt;/quote&gt; I suggested.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in
blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly
scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s
nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.
It was dark in colour and flakey—such an ash as is only made by a
Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes—in fact, I
have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can
distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or
of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective
differs from the &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; type.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And the florid face?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was
right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed my hand over my brow. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My head is in a whirl,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked;
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these
two men—if there were two men—into an empty house? What has become of
the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take
poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the
murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring
there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word
RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of
reconciling all these facts.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My companion smiled approvingly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,&lt;/quote&gt; he
said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up
my mind on the main facts. As to poor &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;’s discovery it was
simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by
suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German.
The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion.
Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we
may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy
imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry
into a wrong channel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case,
Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained
his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will
come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I shall never do that,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;you have brought detection as
near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way
in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as
sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of
her beauty.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I’ll tell you one other thing,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Patent-leathers and
Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway
together as friendly as possible—arm-in-arm, in all probability. When
they got inside they walked up and down the room—or rather,
Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I
could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he
grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of
his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no
doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know
myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good
working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want
to go to Halle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way
through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the
dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That’s Audley Court in there,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, pointing to a narrow slit in
the line of dead-coloured brick. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You’ll find me here when you come
back.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us
into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We
picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of
discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was
decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was
engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we
were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in
his slumbers. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I made my report at the office,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it
pensively. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own
lips,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,&lt;/quote&gt; the constable
answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though
determined not to omit anything in his narrative.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;My time is from ten at
night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White
Hart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it
began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher—him who has the Holland Grove
beat—and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.
Presently—maybe about two or a little after—I thought I would take a
look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was
precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,
though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’
between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when
suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same
house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty
on account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,
though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid
fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the
window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the
door——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,&lt;/quote&gt; my companion
interrupted. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What did you do that for?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; with the
utmost amazement upon his features.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;Why, that’s true, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; he said; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;though how you come to know it,
Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still
and so lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with
me. I ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I
thought that maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the
drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I
walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but
there wasn’t no sign of him nor of anyone else.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There was no one in the street?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself
together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,
so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a
candle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece—a red wax one—and by its light I
saw——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,
and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried
the kitchen door, and then——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in
his eyes. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;Where was you hid to see all that?&lt;/quote&gt; he cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;It seems to
me that you knows a deal more than you should.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Don’t get arresting me for the murder,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am one of the
hounds and not the wolf; Mr. &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; or &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; will answer for
that. Go on, though. What did you do next?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified
expression. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That
brought Murcher and two more to the spot.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was the street empty then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constable’s features broadened into a grin. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;I’ve seen many a drunk
chap in my time,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;but never anyone so cryin’ drunk as that
cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the
railings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s
New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far less
help.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What sort of a man was he?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;He
was an uncommon drunk sort o’ man,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;He’d ha’ found hisself in
the station if we hadn’t been so took up.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;His face—his dress—didn’t you notice them?&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; broke in
impatiently.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up—me
and Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower
part muffled round——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That will do,&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What became of him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,&lt;/quote&gt; the policeman said, in
an aggrieved voice. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;I’ll wager he found his way home all right.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How was he dressed?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;A brown overcoat.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Had he a whip in his hand?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;A whip—no.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He must have left it behind,&lt;/quote&gt; muttered my companion. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You didn’t
happen to see or hear a cab after that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Rance"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There’s a half-sovereign for you,&lt;/quote&gt; my companion said, standing up and
taking his hat. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the
force. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You
might have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you
held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and
whom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell
you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,
but obviously uncomfortable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The blundering fool,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; said, bitterly, as we drove back to our
lodgings. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good
luck, and not taking advantage of it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this
man tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why
should he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way
of criminals.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no
other way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I
shall have him, Doctor—I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must
thank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have
missed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why
shouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread of
murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to
unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now for
lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing are
splendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so
magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a
lark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="5" num="V"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was
tired out in the afternoon. After &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ departure for the concert, I
lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.
It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that
had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.
Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted
baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the
impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it
difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its
owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most
malignant type, they were certainly those of &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch J. Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, of
Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the
depravity of the victim was no condonement in the eyes of the law.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s
hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he
had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something
which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had
caused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of
strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay
so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had
the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.
As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would
be no easy matter, either for &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; or myself. His quiet
self-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory
which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an
instant conjecture.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was very late in returning—so late, that I knew that the concert
could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table
before he appeared.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It was magnificent,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, as he took his seat. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you remember
what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and
appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of
speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced
by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries
when the world was in its childhood.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That’s rather a broad idea,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret
Nature,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite
yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;To tell the truth, it has,&lt;/quote&gt; I said. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I ought to be more case-hardened
after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at
Maiwand without losing my nerve.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the
imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you
seen the evening paper?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the
fact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon
the floor. It is just as well it does not.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Look at this advertisement,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I had one sent to every
paper this morning immediately after the affair.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated.
It was the first announcement in the &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Found&lt;/quote&gt; column. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;In Brixton Road,
this morning,&lt;/quote&gt; it ran, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway
between the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt;,
221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Excuse my using your name,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If I used my own some of these
dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That is all right,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But supposing anyone applies, I have
no ring.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh yes, you have,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, handing me one. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This will do very well.
It is almost a facsimile.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why, the man in the brown coat—our florid friend with the square toes.
If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Would he not consider it as too dangerous?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason
to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose
the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the
house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police
already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle
burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions
which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put
yourself in that man’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have
occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the
road after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly
look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the
articles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be
overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his
eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.
He would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And then?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and
though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for
anything.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the
pistol the table had been cleared, and &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was engaged in his
favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The plot thickens,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, as I entered; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have just had an answer
to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And that is?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked eagerly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My fiddle would be the better for new strings,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Put your
pistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an
ordinary way. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at
him too hard.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is eight o’clock now,&lt;/quote&gt; I said, glancing at my watch.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door
slightly. That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This
is a queer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday—‘De Jure inter
Gentes’—published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’
head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed
volume was struck off.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Who is the printer?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very
faded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William
Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His
writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; rose
softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the
servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she
opened it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;Does &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt; live here?&lt;/quote&gt; asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We
could not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one
began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling
one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he
listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a
feeble tap at the door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Come in,&lt;/quote&gt; I cried.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very
old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be
dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she
stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket
with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face
had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do
to keep my countenance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our
advertisement. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,&lt;/quote&gt; she said,
dropping another curtsey; &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It
belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,
which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he’d say if
he come ‘ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think,
he being short enough at the best o’ times, but more especially when he
has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night
along with——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Is that her ring?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;The Lord be thanked!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the old woman; &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;Sally will be a glad woman
this night. That’s the ring.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And what may your address be?&lt;/quote&gt; I inquired, taking up a pencil.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,&lt;/quote&gt;
said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sharply.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little
red-rimmed eyes. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,&lt;/quote&gt; she said.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;And your name is——?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Sawyer"&gt;My name is Sawyer—her’s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her—and a
smart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward in the
company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and
what with liquor shops——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,&lt;/quote&gt; I interrupted, in obedience to a sign
from my companion; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad
to be able to restore it to the rightful owner.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old
crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs.
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and
rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an
ulster and a cravat. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I’ll follow her,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, hurriedly; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;she must
be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.&lt;/quote&gt; The hall
door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had descended
the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly
along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance
behind. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Either his whole theory is incorrect,&lt;/quote&gt; I thought to myself,
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery.&lt;/quote&gt; There was no
need for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was
impossible until I heard the result of his adventure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might
be, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages
of Henri Murger’s "Vie de Bohème." Ten o’clock passed, and I heard the
footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more
stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same
destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of
his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not
been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the
mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a
hearty laugh.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried,
dropping into his chair; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have chaffed them so much that they would
never have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I
know that I will be even with them in the long run.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What is it then?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had
gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being
foot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler
which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the
address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud
enough to be heard at the other side of the street, ‘Drive to 13,
Duncan Street, Houndsditch,’ she cried. This begins to look genuine, I
thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind.
That’s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away
we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in
question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down
the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver
jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing
came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in
the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of
oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his
passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On
inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a
respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name
either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You don’t mean to say,&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, in amazement, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that that tottering,
feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,
without either you or the driver seeing her?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Old woman be damned!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, sharply. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We were the old
women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active
one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was
inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means
of giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as
lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk
something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice
and turn in.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the
watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his
violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem
which he had set himself to unravel.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="6" num="VI"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The papers next day were full of the "Brixton Mystery," as they termed
it. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it
in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I
still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing
upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:—
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had
seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German
name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister
inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political
refugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in
America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten
laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the
Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers,
the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff
Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government
and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the
sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from
the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening
of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been
residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the
boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.
He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Joseph
Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th
inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of
catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon
the platform. Nothing more is known of them until &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s body
was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,
many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are
questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the
whereabouts of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;. We are glad to learn that &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; and
Mr. &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it
is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily
throw light upon the matter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being
a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated
the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores
a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not
soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these
men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was
punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,
&lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the
deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address
of the house at which he had boarded—a result which was entirely due to
the acuteness and energy of Mr. &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; of Scotland Yard.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; and I read these notices over together at breakfast,
and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I told you that, whatever happened, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; would be sure
to score.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That depends on how it turns out.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught,
it will be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be
_in spite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose.
Whatever they do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un
plus sot qui l’admire.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What on earth is this?&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, for at this moment there came the
pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by
audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,&lt;/quote&gt; said my
companion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a
dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped
eyes on.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘Tention!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little
scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In
future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you
must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;No, sir, we hain’t,&lt;/quote&gt; said one of the youths.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are
your wages.&lt;/quote&gt; He handed each of them a shilling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many
rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than
out of a dozen of the force,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The mere sight of an
official-looking person seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, go
everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all
they want is organisation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter
of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!
Here is &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; coming down the road with beatitude written upon every
feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There
he is!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the
fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and
burst into our sitting-room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;My dear fellow,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, wringing &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ unresponsive hand,
&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive
face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you mean that you are on the right track?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And his name is?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,&lt;/quote&gt; cried
&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We are anxious to
know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I don’t mind if I do,&lt;/quote&gt; the detective answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;The tremendous
exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have
worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain
upon the mind. You will appreciate that, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, for we
are both brain-workers.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You do me too much honour,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, gravely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Let us hear how you
arrived at this most gratifying result.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently
at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of
amusement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;The fun of it is,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;that that fool &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, who thinks
himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is
after the secretary &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, who had no more to do with the crime
than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this
time.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea tickled &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; so much that he laughed until he choked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And how did you get your clue?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, this is
strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to
contend with was the finding of this American’s antecedents. Some
people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or
until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not
&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Tobias Gregson&lt;/person&gt;’s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the
dead man?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; looked quite crest-fallen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I had no idea that you noticed that,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Have you been there?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Ha!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, in a relieved voice; &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;you should never neglect a
chance, however small it may seem.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;To a great mind, nothing is little,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, sententiously.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that
size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.
He had sent the hat to a &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, residing at Charpentier’s
Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Smart—very smart!&lt;/quote&gt; murmured &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I next called upon Madame Charpentier,&lt;/quote&gt; continued the detective. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I
found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,
too—an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the
eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn’t escape my
notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, when you come upon the right scent—a kind of thrill in your
nerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Enoch J. Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, of Cleveland?’ I asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The
daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew
something of the matter.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘At what o’clock did &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Drebber&lt;/person&gt; leave your house for the train?&lt;/quote&gt; I
asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her
agitation. ‘His secretary, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, said that there were two
trains—one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question.
Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she
could get out the single word ‘Yes’—and when it did come it was in a
husky unnatural tone.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm
clear voice.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us be
frank with this gentleman. We _did_ see &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Drebber&lt;/person&gt; again.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;'God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and
  sinking back in her chair. 'You have murdered your brother.'&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth&lt;/quote&gt;, the girl answered
firmly.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences are
worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to &lt;!-- CJK: this is labled as unknow but it is spoken by the mom of alice, with another quote coming after it. Do you want to me to mark it up or not, we can talk about this at our meeting. --&gt;
me, ‘I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on
behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in
this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,
however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to
be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character,
his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered.
‘Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and her
daughter withdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention of
telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I
have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all
without omitting any particular.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Drebber&lt;/person&gt; has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his
secretary, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, had been travelling on the Continent. I
noticed a "Copenhagen" label upon each of their trunks, showing that
that had been their last stopping place. &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; was a quiet
reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.
He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of
his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after
twelve o’clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His
manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.
Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my
daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which,
fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he
actually seized her in his arms and embraced her—an outrage which
caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘But why did you stand all this,’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can get
rid of your boarders when you wish.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God that
I had given him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘But it
was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each—fourteen
pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy
in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for
the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to
leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Well?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave
just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper
is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed
the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in
less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for
drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my
daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his
train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to
her that she should fly with him. 'You are of age,' he said, 'and there
is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the
old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live
like a princess.' Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away
from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her
towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came
into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the
confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.
When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with
a stick in his hand. 'I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us
again,' he said. 'I will just go after him and see what he does with
himself.' With those words he took his hat and started off down the
street. The next morning we heard of &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s mysterious death.’&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps and
pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.
I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there
should be no possibility of a mistake.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s quite exciting,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, with a yawn. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What
happened next?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;When Mrs. Charpentier paused,&lt;/quote&gt; the detective continued, &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I saw that
the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way
which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her
son returned.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘I do not know,’ she answered.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Not know?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘After you went to bed?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Yes.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘When did you go to bed?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘About eleven.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Yes.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Possibly four or five?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘Yes.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘What was he doing during that time?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out
where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and
arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come
quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, ‘I suppose you are
arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his
alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as
having with him when he followed &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;. It was a stout oak cudgel.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What is your theory, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Well, my theory is that he followed &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; as far as the Brixton
Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course
of which &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the
stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night
was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of
his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and
the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks
to throw the police on to the wrong scent.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well done!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; in an encouraging voice. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Really, &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, you
are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,&lt;/quote&gt; the detective
answered proudly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;The young man volunteered a statement, in which he
said that after following &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; some time, the latter perceived him,
and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an
old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this
old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I
think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is
to think of &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am
afraid he won’t make much of it. Why, by Jove, here’s the very man
himself!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was indeed &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, who had ascended the stairs while we were
talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness
which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.
His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged
and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be
embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling
nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;This is a most
extraordinary case,&lt;/quote&gt; he said at last—&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;a most incomprehensible affair.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Ah, you find it so, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, triumphantly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;I
thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the
Secretary, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Joseph Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;The Secretary, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Joseph Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; gravely, &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;was
murdered at Halliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="7" num="VII"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The intelligence with which &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; greeted us was so momentous and so
unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; sprang
out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I
stared in silence at &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, whose lips were compressed and
his brows drawn down over his eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; too!&lt;/quote&gt; he muttered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The plot thickens.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;It was quite thick enough before,&lt;/quote&gt; grumbled &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, taking a chair.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Are you—are you sure of this piece of intelligence?&lt;/quote&gt; stammered
&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I have just come from his room,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I was the first to
discover what had occurred.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We have been hearing &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;’s view of the matter,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; observed.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I have no objection,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; answered, seating himself. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I freely
confess that I was of the opinion that &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; was concerned in the
death of &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;. This fresh development has shown me that I was
completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out
what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston
Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in
the morning &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; had been found in the Brixton Road. The question
which confronted me was to find out how &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; had been employed
between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him
afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the
man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then
set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the
vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; and his companion
had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put
up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the
station again next morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,&lt;/quote&gt;
remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making
enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and
at eight o’clock I reached Halliday’s Private Hotel, in Little George
Street. On my enquiry as to whether a &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; was living there,
they at once answered me in the affirmative.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;‘No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘He
has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;‘Where is he now?’ I asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;‘He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;‘I will go up and see him at once,’ I said.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and
lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me
the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor
leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about
to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish,
in spite of my twenty years’ experience. From under the door there
curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the
passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.
I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he
saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to
it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the
window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was
quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and
cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as
being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of
&lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Joseph Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side,
which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part
of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,
even before &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;That was it,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all
silent for a while.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the
deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to
his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle
tingled as I thought of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;The man was seen,&lt;/quote&gt; continued &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;A milk boy, passing on his way
to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews
at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay
there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which
was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the
ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to
be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular
notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for
him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a
reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have
stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found
blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and
marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I glanced at &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; on hearing the description of the murderer, which
tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of
exultation or satisfaction upon his face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the
murderer?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Nothing. &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; had &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s purse in his pocket, but it seems
that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd
pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these
extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were
no papers or memoranda in the murdered man’s pocket, except a single
telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the
words, ‘J. H. is in Europe.’ There was no name appended to this
message.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And there was nothing else?&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Nothing of any importance. The man’s novel, with which he had read
himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair
beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the
window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The last link,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, exultantly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My case is complete.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two detectives stared at him in amazement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have now in my hands,&lt;/quote&gt; my companion said, confidently, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;all the
threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details
to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the
time that &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; parted from &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; at the station, up to the
discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own
eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand
upon those pills?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I have them,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, producing a small white box; &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I took them
and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place
of safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking
these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance
to them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Give them here,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; turning to me, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;are those
ordinary pills?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,
round, and almost transparent against the light. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;From their lightness
and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,&lt;/quote&gt; I
remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely so,&lt;/quote&gt; answered &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now would you mind going down and
fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so
long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain
yesterday.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It’s laboured
breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.
Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded
the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the
rug.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I will now cut one of these pills in two,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and drawing
his penknife he suited the action to the word. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One half we return into
the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine
glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our
friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;This may be very interesting,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, in the injured tone of
one who suspects that he is being laughed at, &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I cannot see, however,
what it has to do with the death of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Joseph Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has
everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the
mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps
it up readily enough.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and
placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in
silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling
effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched
upon the cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither
the better nor the worse for its draught.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without
result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared
upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the
table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was
his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two
detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check
which he had met.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It can’t be a coincidence,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, at last springing from his chair
and pacing wildly up and down the room; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;it is impossible that it
should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the
case of &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; are actually found after the death of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;. And
yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of
reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this
wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!&lt;/quote&gt; With a
perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in
two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The
unfortunate creature’s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in
it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid
and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his
forehead. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I should have more faith,&lt;/quote&gt; he said; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I ought to know by this
time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of
deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other
interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly
poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that
before ever I saw the box at all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could
hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,
however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me
that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began
to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;All this seems strange to you,&lt;/quote&gt; continued &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;because you failed
at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single
real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize
upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to
confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence
of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more
obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.
It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most
commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no
new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder
would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of
the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those
_outré_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it
remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more
difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, who had listened to this address with considerable
impatience, could contain himself no longer. &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Look here, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart
man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something
more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking
the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young
Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;
went after his man, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, and it appears that he was wrong too.
You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more
than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to
ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the
man who did it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I cannot help feeling that &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; is right, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more
than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence
which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Any delay in arresting the assassin,&lt;/quote&gt; I observed, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;might give him time
to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus pressed by us all, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; showed signs of irresolution. He
continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest
and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There will be no more murders,&lt;/quote&gt; he said at last, stopping abruptly and
facing us. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You can put that consideration out of the question. You
have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere
knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power
of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have
good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a
thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate
man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by
another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea
that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but
if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish
in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city.
Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that
I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force,
and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of
course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am
prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I
can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I
shall do so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,
or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had
flushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other’s beady
eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time
to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the
spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his
insignificant and unsavoury person.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wiggins"&gt;Please, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, touching his forelock, &lt;quote spokeBy="Wiggins"&gt;I have the cab
downstairs.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Good boy,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, blandly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why don’t you introduce this pattern
at Scotland Yard?&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from
a drawer. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an
instant.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;The old pattern is good enough,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;if we can only
find the man to put them on.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very good, very good,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, smiling. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The cabman may as well
help me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about
to set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.
There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and
began to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the
room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, kneeling over
his task, and never turning his head.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put
down his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the
jangling of metal, and &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sprang to his feet again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Gentlemen,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, with flashing eyes, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;let me introduce you to &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Mr.
Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;, the murderer of &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch Drebber&lt;/person&gt; and of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Joseph
Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing occurred in a moment—so quickly that I had no time to
realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’
triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman’s dazed,
savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had
appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might
have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,
the prisoner wrenched himself free from &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’s grasp, and hurled
himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but
before he got quite through, &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, and &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sprang upon
him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and
then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he,
that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to
have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and
hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss
of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until
&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and
half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of
no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his
feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless
and panting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We have his cab,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It will serve to take him to
Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, with a pleasant
smile, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very
welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no
danger that I will refuse to answer them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;chapter id="8" num="I"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies
an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a
barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to
Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado
upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature
always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises
snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are
swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are
enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are
grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the
common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or
of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other
hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight
of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their
prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily
through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark
ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks.
These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the
northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach
stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of
alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On
the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,
with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of
country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.
There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,
grey earth—above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,
there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing
but silence—complete and heart-subduing silence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad
plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one
sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is
lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down
by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered
white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull
deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some
large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have
belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one
may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of
those who had fallen by the wayside.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,
eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance
was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the
region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was
nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the
brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones;
his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white;
his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre;
while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that
of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and
yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a
wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his
clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed
what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man
was dying—dying from hunger and from thirst.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little
elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the
great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of
savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might
indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there
was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild
questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to
an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Why
not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,&lt;/quote&gt; he
muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless
rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had
carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too
heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground
with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a
little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face,
with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;You’ve hurt me!&lt;/quote&gt; said a childish voice reproachfully.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Have I though,&lt;/quote&gt; the man answered penitently, &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I didn’t go for to do
it.&lt;/quote&gt; As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty
little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart
pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother’s care. The
child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she
had suffered less than her companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;How is it now?&lt;/quote&gt; he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the
towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Kiss it and make it well,&lt;/quote&gt; she said, with perfect gravity, showing the
injured part up to him. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;That’s what mother used to do. Where’s
mother?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Mother’s gone. I guess you’ll see her before long.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Gone, eh!&lt;/quote&gt; said the little girl. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Funny, she didn’t say good-bye; she
‘most always did if she was just goin’ over to Auntie’s for tea, and
now she’s been away three days. Say, it’s awful dry, ain’t it? Ain’t
there no water, nor nothing to eat?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;No, there ain’t nothing, dearie. You’ll just need to be patient
awhile, and then you’ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like
that, and then you’ll feel bullier. It ain’t easy to talk when your
lips is like leather, but I guess I’d best let you know how the cards
lie. What’s that you’ve got?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Pretty things! fine things!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the little girl enthusiastically,
holding up two glittering fragments of mica. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;When we goes back to home
I’ll give them to brother Bob.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;You’ll see prettier things than them soon,&lt;/quote&gt; said the man confidently.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though—you remember when
we left the river?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Oh, yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Well, we reckoned we’d strike another river soon, d’ye see. But there
was somethin’ wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin’, and it didn’t
turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you
and—and——&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;And you couldn’t wash yourself,&lt;/quote&gt; interrupted his companion gravely,
staring up at his grimy visage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian
Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,
your mother.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Then mother’s a deader too,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the little girl dropping her face
in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some
chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and
we tramped it together. It don’t seem as though we’ve improved matters.
There’s an almighty small chance for us now!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Do you mean that we are going to die too?&lt;/quote&gt; asked the child, checking
her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I guess that’s about the size of it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Why didn’t you say so before?&lt;/quote&gt; she said, laughing gleefully. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;You gave
me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we’ll be with
mother again.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Yes, you will, dearie.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;And you too. I’ll tell her how awful good you’ve been. I’ll bet she
meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot
of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was
fond of. How long will it be first?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I don’t know—not very long.&lt;/quote&gt; The man’s eyes were fixed upon the
northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared
three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly
did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large
brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and
then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards,
the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Cocks and hens,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their
ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Say, did
God make this country?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;In course He did,&lt;/quote&gt; said her companion, rather startled by this
unexpected question.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,&lt;/quote&gt; the
little girl continued. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I guess somebody else made the country in these
parts. It’s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the
trees.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;What would ye think of offering up prayer?&lt;/quote&gt; the man asked diffidently.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;It ain’t night yet,&lt;/quote&gt; she answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;It don’t matter. It ain’t quite regular, but He won’t mind that, you
bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the
waggon when we was on the Plains.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Why don’t you say some yourself?&lt;/quote&gt; the child asked, with wondering
eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I disremember them,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I hain’t said none since I was half
the height o’ that gun. I guess it’s never too late. You say them out,
and I’ll stand by and come in on the choruses.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Then you’ll need to kneel down, and me too,&lt;/quote&gt; she said, laying the
shawl out for that purpose. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;You’ve got to put your hands up like this.
It makes you feel kind o’ good.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see
it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the
little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her
chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the
cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom
they were face to face, while the two voices—the one thin and clear,
the other deep and harsh—united in the entreaty for mercy and
forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow
of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad
breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but
Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights
he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids
drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the
breast, until the man’s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses
of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight
would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali
plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and
hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but
gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid,
well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it
became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of
moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to
the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon
the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in
these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary
bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered
tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up
through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great
caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the
head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet
visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the
straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.
Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who
toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white
coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but
rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of
circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the
clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of
humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud
as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above
them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced
men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On
reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council
among themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The wells are to the right, my brothers,&lt;/quote&gt; said one, a hard-lipped,
clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;To the right of the Sierra Blanco—so we shall reach the Rio Grande,&lt;/quote&gt;
said another.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Fear not for water,&lt;/quote&gt; cried a third. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;He who could draw it from the
rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Amen! Amen!&lt;/quote&gt; responded the whole party.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and
keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag
above them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,
showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight
there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while
fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word
‘Redskins’ was on every lip.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;There can’t be any number of Injuns here,&lt;/quote&gt; said the elderly man who
appeared to be in command. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;We have passed the Pawnees, and there are
no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Shall I go forward and see, Brother &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; asked one of the
band.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;And I,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;and I,&lt;/quote&gt; cried a dozen voices.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Leave your horses below and we will await you here,&lt;/quote&gt; the Elder
answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their
horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the
object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and
noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The
watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock
until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who
had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw
him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on
joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met
their eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a
single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,
long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His
placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.
Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his
brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast
of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular
line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her
infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white
socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast
to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock
above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at
the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment
and flapped sullenly away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about
them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down
upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him,
and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts.
His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he
passed his boney hand over his eyes. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;This is what they call delirium,
I guess,&lt;/quote&gt; he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the
skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the
wondering questioning gaze of childhood.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways
that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little
girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her
gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;My name is &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; the wanderer explained; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;me and that little
un are all that’s left o’ twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o’
thirst and hunger away down in the south.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Is she your child?&lt;/quote&gt; asked someone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I guess she is now,&lt;/quote&gt; the other cried, defiantly; &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;she’s mine ‘cause I
saved her. No man will take her from me. She’s &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; from this
day on. Who are you, though?&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, glancing with curiosity at
his stalwart, sunburned rescuers; &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;there seems to be a powerful lot of
ye.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Nigh upon ten thousand,&lt;/quote&gt; said one of the young men; &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;we are the
persecuted children of God—the chosen of the Angel Merona.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;I never heard tell on him,&lt;/quote&gt; said the wanderer. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;He appears to have
chosen a fair crowd of ye.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Do not jest at that which is sacred,&lt;/quote&gt; said the other sternly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;We are
of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian
letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy
&lt;person perName="Joseph_Smith"&gt;Joseph&lt;/person&gt; Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of
Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a
refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the
heart of the desert.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I
see,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;you are the Mormons.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;We are the Mormons,&lt;/quote&gt; answered his companions with one voice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;And where are you going?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our
Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with
you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded
by crowds of the pilgrims—pale-faced meek-looking women, strong
laughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of
astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they
perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the
other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a
great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was
conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of
its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were
furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there
sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but
whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He
was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid
it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then
he turned to the two castaways.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;If we take you with us,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, in solemn words, &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;it can only be as
believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better
far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you
should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts
the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Guess I’ll come with you on any terms,&lt;/quote&gt; said Ferrier, with such
emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader
alone retained his stern, impressive expression.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Take him, Brother &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;give him food and drink, and
the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy
creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;On, on to Zion!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled
down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away
in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a
creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the
whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the
two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was
already awaiting them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;You shall remain here,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;In a few days you will have
recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and
for ever you are of our religion. &lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Brigham Young&lt;/person&gt; has said it, and he has
spoken with the voice of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Joseph&lt;/person&gt; Smith, which is the voice of God.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="9" num="II"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;THE FLOWER OF UTAH&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured
by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From
the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky
Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in
history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue,
and disease—every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had
all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and
the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among
them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt
prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight
beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was
the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for
evermore.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Young&lt;/person&gt; speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as
a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the
future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and
allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The
tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the
town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country
there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next
summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything
prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which
they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.
From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the
clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the
monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe
through many dangers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two castaways, &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; and the little girl who had shared his
fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons
to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; was borne
along pleasantly enough in Elder &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;’s waggon, a retreat which
she shared with the Mormon’s three wives and with his son, a headstrong
forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of
childhood, from the shock caused by her mother’s death, she soon became
a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her
moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; having recovered
from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an
indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new
companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was
unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as
fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of
&lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Young&lt;/person&gt; himself, and of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, Kemball, Johnston, and &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, who
were the four principal Elders.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the farm thus acquired &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; built himself a substantial
log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it
grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen
in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution
enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his
lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him
prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his
neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in
twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City
who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant
Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John
Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one way and only one in which he offended the
susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion
could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner
of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal,
but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his
determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his
adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and
reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love
affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of
the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; remained strictly celibate.
In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young
settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and
straight-walking man.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted
father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the
balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to
the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,
her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon
the high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts
revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping
through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang,
and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the
West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her
father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of
American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had
developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious
change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of
all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the
touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,
with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has
awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and
remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.
In the case of &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; the occasion was serious enough in itself,
apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many
besides.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as
the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields
and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty
high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to
the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the
Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were
droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands,
and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their
interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her
way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy
Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut
hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in
the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with
all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was
to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in
astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with
their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at
the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road
blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking
herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass
this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.
Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed
in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving
stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to
deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took
advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of
pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one
of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact
with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant
it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and
tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider.
The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse
brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It
was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a
slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and
terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began
to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising
cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might
have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her
elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy
brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way
through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,&lt;/quote&gt; said her preserver, respectfully.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;I’m awful
frightened,&lt;/quote&gt; she said, naively; &lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;whoever would have thought that Poncho
would have been so scared by a lot of cows?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Thank God you kept your seat,&lt;/quote&gt; the other said earnestly. He was a&lt;!-- CJK: I put the guys name in as JH but I am not sure, this goes down till John Ferrier is mentioned, about 20 lines --&gt;
tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse,
and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over
his shoulders. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I guess you are the daughter of &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he
remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask
him if he remembers the &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;s of St. Louis. If he’s the same
Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?&lt;/quote&gt; she asked, demurely.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes
  sparkled with pleasure. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I’ll do so,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;we’ve been in the
mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting
condition. He must take us as he finds us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,&lt;/quote&gt; she answered,
&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never
got over it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Neither would I,&lt;/quote&gt; said her companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.
You ain’t even a friend of ours.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy
Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; laughed aloud.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;There, I didn’t mean that,&lt;/quote&gt; she said; &lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;of course, you are a friend
now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t
trust me with his business any more. Good-bye!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Good-bye,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over
her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her
riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of
dust.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.
He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,
and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital
enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as
keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had
drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young
girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his
volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from
his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that
neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of
such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love
which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy
of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will
and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he
undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if
human effort and human perseverance could render him successful.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He called on &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; that night, and many times again, until his
face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the
valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the
news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; was able to tell him, and in a style which interested
Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and
could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in
those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a
silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to
be had, &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; had been there in search of them. He soon became
a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues.
On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her
bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no
longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,
but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her
affections.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled
up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He
threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I am off, Lucy,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing
tenderly down into her face; &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I won’t ask you to come with me now, but
will you be ready to come when I am here again?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;And when will that be?&lt;/quote&gt; she asked, blushing and laughing.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my
darling. There’s no one who can stand between us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;And how about father?&lt;/quote&gt; she asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all
right. I have no fear on that head.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’s
no more to be said,&lt;/quote&gt; she whispered, with her cheek against his broad
breast.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Thank God!&lt;/quote&gt; he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;It is
settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are
waiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling—good-bye. In two
months you shall see me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his
horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though
afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what
he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he
vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the
happiest girl in all Utah.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="10" num="III"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three weeks had passed since &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; and his comrades had
departed from Salt Lake City. &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;’s heart was sore within him
when he thought of the young man’s return, and of the impending loss of
his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the
arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always
determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever
induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he
regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever
he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was
inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to
express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in
the Land of the Saints.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, a dangerous matter—so dangerous that even the most saintly dared
only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something
which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a
swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned
persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible
description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German
Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put
a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over
the State of Utah.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this
organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and
omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out
against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or
what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,
but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands
of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by
annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this
terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went
about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the
wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the
recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards
to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The
supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female
population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange
rumours began to be bandied about—rumours of murdered immigrants and
rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women
appeared in the harems of the Elders—women who pined and wept, and bore
upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated
wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,
stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These
tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and
re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.
To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite
Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible
results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it
inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless
society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and
violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.
The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the
Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at
night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every
man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were
nearest his heart.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fine morning, &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; was about to set out to his wheatfields,
when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,
saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His
heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great
&lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Brigham Young&lt;/person&gt; himself. Full of trepidation—for he knew that such a
visit boded him little good—Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon
chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and
followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;Brother Ferrier,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly
from under his light-coloured eyelashes, &lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;the true believers have been
good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the
desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,
gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our
protection. Is not this so?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;It is so,&lt;/quote&gt; answered &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you
should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.
This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you
have neglected.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;And how have I neglected it?&lt;/quote&gt; asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in
expostulation. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not
attended at the Temple? Have I not——?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;Where are your wives?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Young&lt;/person&gt;, looking round him. &lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;Call them in,
that I may greet them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;It is true that I have not married,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;But women were
few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a
lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,&lt;/quote&gt; said the leader of
the Mormons. &lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found
favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; groaned internally.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve—stories that
she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.
What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Joseph&lt;/person&gt; Smith?
‘Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she
wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.’ This being so, it is
impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your
daughter to violate it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; made no answer, but he played nervously with his
riding-whip.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested—so it has been
decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would
not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all
choice. We Elders have many heifers,[1] but our children must also be
provided. &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; has a son, and &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; has a son, and either of
them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose
between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say
you to that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Heber C. Kemball, in one of his sermons, alludes to his hundred
wives under this endearing epithet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;You will give us time,&lt;/quote&gt; he said at last. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;My daughter is very &lt;!-- CJK: Would not hurt for someone to check my work here, just to make sure I am not confusing the names --&gt;
young—she is scarce of an age to marry.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;She shall have a month to choose,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Young&lt;/person&gt;, rising from his seat.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;At the end of that time she shall give her answer.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and
  flashing eyes. &lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;It were better for you, &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he thundered,
  &lt;quote spokeBy="Brigham_Young"&gt;that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra
Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of
the Holy Four!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and
Ferrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he
should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon
his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her
pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;I could not help it,&lt;/quote&gt; she said, in answer to his look. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;His voice rang
through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Don’t you scare yourself,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered, drawing her to him, and
passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair.
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;We’ll fix it up somehow or another. You don’t find your fancy kind o’
lessening for this chap, do you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;No; of course not. I shouldn’t care to hear you say you did. He’s a
likely lad, and he’s a Christian, which is more than these folk here,
in spite o’ all their praying and preaching. There’s a party starting
for Nevada to-morrow, and I’ll manage to send him a message letting him
know the hole we are in. If I know anything o’ that young man, he’ll be
back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucy laughed through her tears at her father’s description.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that
I am frightened, dear. One hears—one hears such dreadful stories about
those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to
them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;But we haven’t opposed him yet,&lt;/quote&gt; her father answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;It will be time
to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at
the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Leave Utah!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;That’s about the size of it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;But the farm?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell
the truth, Lucy, it isn’t the first time I have thought of doing it. I
don’t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their
darned prophet. I’m a free-born American, and it’s all new to me. Guess
I’m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might
chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the
opposite direction.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;But they won’t let us leave,&lt;/quote&gt; his daughter objected.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Wait till &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/person&gt; comes, and we’ll soon manage that. In the
meantime, don’t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don’t get your eyes
swelled up, else he’ll be walking into me when he sees you. There’s
nothing to be afeared about, and there’s no danger at all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,
but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the
fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and
loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="11" num="IV"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;A FLIGHT FOR LIFE&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,
&lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his
acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him
with his message to &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;. In it he told the young man of the
imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he
should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and
returned home with a lighter heart.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to
each of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering
to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a
long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet
cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse
bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in
his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; as
he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the
conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Maybe you don’t know us,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;This here is the son of Elder
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, and I’m &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Joseph Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, who travelled with you in the
desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the
true fold.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;As He will all the nations in His own good time,&lt;/quote&gt; said the other in a
  nasal voice; &lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;We have come,&lt;/quote&gt; continued &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;at the advice of our fathers to
solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to
you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; here has
seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Nay, nay, Brother &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the other; &lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;the question is not
how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now
given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;But my prospects are better,&lt;/quote&gt; said the other, warmly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;When the Lord
removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather
factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;It will be for the maiden to decide,&lt;/quote&gt; rejoined young &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, smirking
at his own reflection in the glass. &lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;We will leave it all to her
decision.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this dialogue, &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; had stood fuming in the doorway,
hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Look here,&lt;/quote&gt; he said at last, striding up to them, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;when my daughter
summons you, you can come, but until then I don’t want to see your
faces again.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this
competition between them for the maiden’s hand was the highest of
honours both to her and her father.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;There are two ways out of the room,&lt;/quote&gt; cried Ferrier; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;there is the
door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,
that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The
old farmer followed them to the door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,&lt;/quote&gt; he said,
sardonically.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;You shall smart for this!&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; cried, white with rage. &lt;quote spokeBy="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;You
have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to
the end of your days.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,&lt;/quote&gt; cried young &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;;
&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;He will arise and smite you!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Then I’ll start the smiting,&lt;/quote&gt; exclaimed &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; furiously, and would
have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and
restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses’
hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;The young canting rascals!&lt;/quote&gt; he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from
his forehead; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the
wife of either of them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;And so should I, father,&lt;/quote&gt; she answered, with spirit; &lt;quote spokeBy="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;but &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/person&gt;
will soon be here.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for
we do not know what their next move may be.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and
help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted
daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been
such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If
minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this
arch rebel. &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; knew that his wealth and position would be of no
avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been
spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He
was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which
hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this
suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,
however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,
with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from
&lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Young&lt;/person&gt; as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an
unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his
surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed
just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:—
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then——"
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How
this warning came into his room puzzled &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; sorely, for his
servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been
secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but
the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were
evidently the balance of the month which &lt;person perName="Brigham_Young"&gt;Young&lt;/person&gt; had promised. What
strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such
mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck
him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their
breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the
centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the
number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not
enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and
ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27
had been painted upon the outside of his door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his
unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some
conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the
month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,
sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards
stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John
Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A
horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of
them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled
look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that
was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news
of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there
came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a
driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking
that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to
four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of
escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains
which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The
more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could
pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he
would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.
Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life
itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter’s
dishonour.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles,
and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown
the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the
last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague
and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter—what was
to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the
invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon
the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound—low,
but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of
the house. &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; crept into the hall and listened intently. There was
a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was
repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the
panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry
out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent
who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;
felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook
his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt
and threw the door open.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were
twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the
farmer’s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on
the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier
looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at
his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face
upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with
his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first
thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying
man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into
the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within
the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to
the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Good God!&lt;/quote&gt; gasped &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;How you scared me! Whatever made you
come in like that.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Give me food,&lt;/quote&gt; the other said, hoarsely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I have had no time for bite
or sup for eight-and-forty hours.&lt;/quote&gt; He flung himself upon the cold meat
and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host’s supper,
and devoured it voraciously. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Does Lucy bear up well?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked, when
he had satisfied his hunger.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Yes. She does not know the danger,&lt;/quote&gt; her father answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I
crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they’re not
quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; felt a different man now that he realized that he had a
devoted ally. He seized the young man’s leathery hand and wrung it
cordially. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;You’re a man to be proud of,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;There are not many
who would come to share our danger and our troubles.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;You’ve hit it there, pard,&lt;/quote&gt; the young hunter answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I have a
respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I’d think twice
before I put my head into such a hornet’s nest. It’s Lucy that brings
me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o’
the &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt; family in Utah.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;What are we to do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.
I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much
money have you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for
Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as
well that the servants do not sleep in the house.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching
journey, &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; packed all the eatables that he could find into
a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by
experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had
hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his
daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the
lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was
much to be done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;We must make our start at once,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;, speaking in a
low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the
peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;The front and back
entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the
side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two
miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we
should be half-way through the mountains.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;What if we are stopped,&lt;/quote&gt; asked Ferrier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt; slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his
tunic. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them
with us,&lt;/quote&gt; he said with a sinister smile.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the
darkened window &lt;person perName="Ferrier"&gt;Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; peered over the fields which had been his own,
and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved
himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and
happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.
All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad
silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the
spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set
expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house
he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; had the
scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a
few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and
carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the
night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With
bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained
the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap
which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when
the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the
shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was as well that his prairie training had given &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; the
ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the
melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of
them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small
distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the
gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal
cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;To-morrow at midnight,&lt;/quote&gt; said the first who appeared to be in
authority. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;It is well,&lt;/quote&gt; returned the other. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Shall I tell Brother &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Seven to five!&lt;/quote&gt; repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away
in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some
form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died
away in the distance, &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; sprang to his feet, and helping
his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the
top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her
strength appeared to fail her.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hurry on! hurry on!&lt;/quote&gt; he gasped from time to time. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;We are through the
line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet
anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid
recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a
rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged
peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led
between them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting
them. With unerring instinct &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; picked his way among the
great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he
came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful
animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old
Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/person&gt;
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt; led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face
Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a
thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic
columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified
monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all
advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow
in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that
only practised riders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of
all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light
within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the
terrible despotism from which they were flying.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the
jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most
desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and
pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark
and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them
as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Who goes
there?&lt;/quote&gt; rang through the silent ravine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Travellers for Nevada,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;, with his hand upon the
rifle which hung by his saddle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down
at them as if dissatisfied at their reply.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;By whose permission?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Ferrier"&gt;The Holy Four,&lt;/quote&gt; answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught
him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Nine from seven,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the sentinel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Seven from five,&lt;/quote&gt; returned &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; promptly, remembering the
countersign which he had heard in the garden.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Pass, and the Lord go with you,&lt;/quote&gt; said the voice from above. Beyond his
post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a
trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon
his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen
people, and that freedom lay before them.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="12" num="V"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;THE AVENGING ANGELS&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular
and rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt;’s
intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track
once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage
beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks
hemmed them in, peeping over each other’s shoulders to the far horizon.
So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch
and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only
a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear
entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with
trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they
passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which
woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses
into a gallop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great
mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until
they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the
hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild
torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered
their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her
father would fain have rested longer, but &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; was
inexorable. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;They will be upon our track by this time,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for
the remainder of our lives.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and
by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from
their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,
where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there
huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep. Before
daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had
seen no signs of any pursuers, and &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; began to think that
they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose
enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could
reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store
of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,
however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had
frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.
Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and
made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for
they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the
air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy
adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of
whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man
and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three
animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks
hid them from his view.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another
without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and
other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the
vicinity. At last, after two or three hours’ fruitless search, he was
thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he
saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the
edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there
stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed
with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn—for so it is called—was
acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to
the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction,
and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon
a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The
animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the
precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself
with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy
over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening
was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he
realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had
wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no
easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in
which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which
were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from
the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a
mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before.
Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with
the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark
before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him.
Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the
moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the
obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from
his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the
reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he
carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their
journey.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left
them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs
which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,
for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart
he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud
halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an
answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary
silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless
repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no
whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time
ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards
frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the
fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,
but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead
silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to
convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the
remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only
too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during
his absence—a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no
traces behind it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bewildered and stunned by this blow, &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; felt his head spin
round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He
was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from
his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the
smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help
to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet
of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the
fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had
afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of
his companions with them? &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; had almost persuaded himself
that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which
made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one
side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had
assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything
but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived
that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the
cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the
point:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JOHN FERRIER,
FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY,
Died August 4th, 1860.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,
then, and this was all his epitaph. &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; looked wildly round
to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy
had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original
destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder’s son. As the young
fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to
prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in
his last silent resting-place.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs
from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least
devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness,
which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived.
As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which
could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution,
brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring
energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim,
white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and
having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him
for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he
set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the
avenging angels.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he
had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down
among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak
he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle
Cañon, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he
could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he
leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent
widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there
were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of
festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he
heard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding
towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named
Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He
therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of
finding out what &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;’s fate had been.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I am &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;You remember me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment—indeed, it was
difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly
white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former
days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,
the man’s surprise changed to consternation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Cowper"&gt;You are mad to come here,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="Cowper"&gt;It is as much as my own life is
worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from
the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I don’t fear them, or their warrant,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt; said, earnestly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;You must
know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you
hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For
God’s sake, don’t refuse to answer me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Cowper"&gt;What is it?&lt;/quote&gt; the Mormon asked uneasily. &lt;quote spokeBy="Cowper"&gt;Be quick. The very rocks have
ears and the trees eyes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;What has become of &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Cowper"&gt;She was married yesterday to young &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;. Hold up, man, hold up, you
have no life left in you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Don’t mind me,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt; faintly. He was white to the very lips, and
had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Married,
you say?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Cowper"&gt;Married yesterday—that’s what those flags are for on the Endowment
House. There was some words between young &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; and young &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;
as to which was to have her. They’d both been in the party that
followed them, and &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; had shot her father, which seemed to give
him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s
party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one
won’t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.
She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Yes, I am off,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;, who had risen from his seat. His
face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its
expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Cowper"&gt;Where are you going?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Never mind,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,
strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains
to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so
fierce and so dangerous as himself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it
was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful
marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her
head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish
husband, who had married her principally for the sake of &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;’s
property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his
other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the
burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in
the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and
astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking,
weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a
glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white
silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;.
Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead,
and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her
finger. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;She shall not be buried in that,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried with a fierce
snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and
was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers
might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other
people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet
of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some months &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; lingered among the mountains, leading a
strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for
vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird
figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the
lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;’s
window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On
another occasion, as &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; passed under a cliff a great boulder
crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing
himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in
discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led
repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or
killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the
precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having
their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these
measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and
they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter’s mind
was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge
had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any
other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon
realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant
strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome
food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains,
what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure
to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his
enemy’s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there
to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue
his object without privation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a
combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines
for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his
wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that
memorable night when he had stood by &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;’s grave. Disguised,
and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what
became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be
justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a
schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger
members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the
Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of
the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had
been &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;; and no one knew whither they had gone.
Rumour reported that &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; had managed to convert a large part of his
property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his
companion, &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at
all, however, as to their whereabouts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of
revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; never
faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out
by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town
through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into
year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human
bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he
had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but
a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that
Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He
returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all
arranged. It chanced, however, that &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, looking from his window,
had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his
eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by
&lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, who had become his private secretary, and represented to
him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and
hatred of an old rival. That evening &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; was taken into
custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some
weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had
departed for Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred
urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for
some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his
approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in
him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city,
working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the
fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;
and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off
for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for
they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running
them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than
quote the old hunter’s own account, as duly recorded in &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt;’s
Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="13" num="VI"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any
ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself
powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that
he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I guess you’re going to take
me to the police-station,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked to &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;My cab’s at
the door. If you’ll loose my legs I’ll walk down to it. I’m not so
light to lift as I used to be.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; exchanged glances as if they thought this
proposition rather a bold one; but &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; at once took the prisoner at
his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ankles.
He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they
were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed
him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark
sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was
as formidable as his personal strength.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;If there’s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are
the man for it,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my
fellow-lodger. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;The way you kept on my trail was a caution.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You had better come with me,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; to the two detectives.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I can drive you,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Good! and &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have
taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no
attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,
and we followed him. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; mounted the box, whipped up the horse,
and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered
into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner’s
name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged.
The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his
duties in a dull mechanical way. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The prisoner will be put before the
magistrates in the course of the week,&lt;/quote&gt; he said; &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;in the mean time, &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Mr.
Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you
that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I’ve got a good deal to say,&lt;/quote&gt; our prisoner said slowly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I want to
tell you gentlemen all about it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hadn’t you better reserve that for your trial?&lt;/quote&gt; asked the Inspector.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I may never be tried,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;You needn’t look startled. It
isn’t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?&lt;/quote&gt; He turned his fierce
dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes; I am,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Then put your hand here,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, with a smile, motioning with his
manacled wrists towards his chest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing
and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed
to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some
powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a
dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why,&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;you have an aortic aneurism!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;That’s what they call it,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, placidly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I went to a Doctor last
week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many
days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from
over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I’ve
done my work now, and I don’t care how soon I go, but I should like to
leave some account of the business behind me. I don’t want to be
remembered as a common cut-throat.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the
advisability of allowing him to tell his story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?&lt;/quote&gt; the former
asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Most certainly there is,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to
take his statement,&lt;/quote&gt; said the Inspector. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are at liberty, sir, to
give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I’ll sit down, with your leave,&lt;/quote&gt; the prisoner said, suiting the action
to the word. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the
tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I’m on the brink
of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is
the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to
me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these words, &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; leaned back in his chair and began the
following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.
I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had
access to &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;’s note-book, in which the prisoner’s words were
taken down exactly as they were uttered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,&lt;/quote&gt; he said; &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;it’s
enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings—a father
and a daughter—and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.
After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was
impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I
knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,
jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You’d have done the same, if
you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She
was forced into marrying that same &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, and broke her heart over
it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his
dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts
should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it
about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two
continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they
could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing
that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,
and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to
follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and
riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner’s
office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to
the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There
was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The
hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the
mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had
a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal
hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were
living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across
them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other
side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at
my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their
recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my
opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they
could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at
night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand
with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay
my hand upon the men I wanted.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was
some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,
and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every
day, and never once saw them separate. &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; himself was drunk half
the time, but &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; was not to be caught napping. I watched them
late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not
discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My
only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon
and leave my work undone.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the
street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to
their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my
horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I
feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station
they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on
to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the
guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for
some hours. &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; seemed to be put out at that, but &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; was
rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle
that I could hear every word that passed between them. &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; said
that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other
would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated
with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together.
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must
go alone. I could not catch what &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; said to that, but the other
burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his
paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that
the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him
that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday’s
Private Hotel; to which &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; answered that he would be back on the
platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my
enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but
singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue
precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction
in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that
strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans
arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who
had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It
chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in
looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one
of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned;
but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate
constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this
great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to
get &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to
solve.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying
for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he
staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a
hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close
that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole
way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets,
until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in
which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in
returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or
so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a
glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;That’s better,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or
more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside
the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared,
one of whom was &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, and the other was a young chap whom I had
never seen before. This fellow had &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; by the collar, and when they
came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent
him half across the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried, shaking his stick at
him; ‘I’ll teach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so hot that I
think he would have thrashed &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; with his cudgel, only that the cur
staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He
ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and
jumped in. ‘Drive me to Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that
I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove
along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might
take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane
have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when
he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again,
and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving
word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time,
and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my
own hands.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Don’t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only
have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself
to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life
if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I
have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and
sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor
was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students some alkaloid, as
he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow
poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant
death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and
when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a
fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble
pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without
the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my
gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I
ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good
deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had
always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I
was to use them.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard
and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within—so
glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you
gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty
long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would
understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my
nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with
excitement. As I drove, I could see old &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; and sweet Lucy
looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I
see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on
each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton
Road.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the
dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;
all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, ‘It’s
time to get out,’ I said.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;‘All right, cabby,’ said he.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,
for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I
had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little
top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the
front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the
daughter were walking in front of us.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;‘It’s infernally dark,’ said he, stamping about.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;‘We’ll soon have a light,’ I said, striking a match and putting it to
a wax candle which I had brought with me. ‘Now, &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch Drebber&lt;/person&gt;,’ I
continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, ‘who
am I?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw
a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which
showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I
saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered
in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and
laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be
sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now
possessed me.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;‘You dog!’ I said; ‘I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.
Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your
wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see
to-morrow’s sun rise.’ He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I
could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time.
The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I
would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my
nose and relieved me.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;‘What do you think of &lt;person perName="Lucy_Ferrier"&gt;Lucy Ferrier&lt;/person&gt; now?’ I cried, locking the door,
and shaking the key in his face. ‘Punishment has been slow in coming,
but it has overtaken you at last.’ I saw his coward lips tremble as I
spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was
useless.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;‘Would you murder me?’ he stammered.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;‘There is no murder,’ I answered. ‘Who talks of murdering a mad dog?
What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her
slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless
harem.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;‘It was not I who killed her father,’ he cried.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;‘But it was you who broke her innocent heart,’ I shrieked, thrusting
the box before him. ‘Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat.
There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you
leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are
ruled by chance.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my
knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I
swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a
minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die.
Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first
warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as
I saw it, and held Lucy’s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was
but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of
pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,
staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I
turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There
was no movement. He was dead!
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice
of it. I don’t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon
the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the
police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I
remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above
him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret
societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New
Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own
blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked
down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the
night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my
hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy’s ring, and found
that it was not there. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only
memento that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I
stooped over &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side
street, I went boldly up to the house—for I was ready to dare anything
rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into
the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to
disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;That was how &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch Drebber&lt;/person&gt; came to his end. All I had to do then was
to do as much for &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, and so pay off &lt;person perName="John_Ferrier"&gt;John Ferrier&lt;/person&gt;’s debt. I
knew that he was staying at Halliday’s Private Hotel, and I hung about
all day, but he never came out. I fancy that he suspected something
when &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was
&lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off
by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which
was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage
of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so
made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and
told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he
had taken so long before. I described &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s death to him, and I
gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at
the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and
flew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would
have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed
his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I have little more to say, and it’s as well, for I am about done up. I
went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I
could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the
yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt;, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at
221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next
thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and
as neatly shackled as ever I saw in my life. That’s the whole of my
story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that
I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thrilling had the man’s narrative been, and his manner was so
impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional
detectives, _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to
be keenly interested in the man’s story. When he finished we sat for
some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of
&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;’s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand
account.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is only one point on which I should like a little more
information,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; said at last. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Who was your accomplice
who came for the ring which I advertised?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;I can tell my own secrets,&lt;/quote&gt;
he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;but I don’t get other people into trouble. I saw your
advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the
ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think
you’ll own he did it smartly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not a doubt of that,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; heartily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, gentlemen,&lt;/quote&gt; the Inspector remarked gravely, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;the forms of the law
must be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before
the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I
will be responsible for him.&lt;/quote&gt; He rang the bell as he spoke, and
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and
I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/chapter&gt;

&lt;chapter id="14" num="VII"&gt;
&lt;chapterTitle&gt;THE CONCLUSION&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the
Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our
testimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/person&gt;
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt; had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be
meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism
burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the
cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in
his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well
done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; will be wild about his death,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; remarked,
as we chatted it over next evening. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Where will their grand
advertisement be now?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I don’t see that they had very much to do with his capture,&lt;/quote&gt; I
answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,&lt;/quote&gt; returned my
companion, bitterly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The question is, what can you make people believe
that you have done. Never mind,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, more brightly, after a
pause. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There
has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there
were several most instructive points about it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Simple!&lt;/quote&gt; I ejaculated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, smiling at my surprise. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The proof of its intrinsic simplicity
is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was
able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That is true,&lt;/quote&gt; said I.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is
usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this
sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very
useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise
it much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason
forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who
can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I confess,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that I do not quite follow you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.
Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you
what the result would be. They can put those events together in their
minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are
few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to
evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led
up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning
backwards, or analytically.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I understand,&lt;/quote&gt; said I.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find
everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the
different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I
approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely
free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway,
and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks
of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during
the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private
carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler
is considerably less wide than a gentleman’s brougham.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden
path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable
for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere
trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its
surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is
so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.
Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has
made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the
constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first
passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been
before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely
obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my
second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were
two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the
length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from
the small and elegant impression left by his boots.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My
well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder,
if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but
the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen
his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or
any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon
their features. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a
slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had
poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon
him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of
exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would
meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The
forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in
criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in
Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not
been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,
then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I
was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political
assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder
had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator
had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there
all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political
one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription
was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my
opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,
however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to
remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point
that I asked &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; whether he had enquired in his telegram to
Cleveland as to any particular point in &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Mr. Drebber&lt;/person&gt;’s former career. He
answered, you remember, in the negative.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which
confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer’s height, and furnished
me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the
length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there
were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had
burst from the murderer’s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that
the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom
that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way
through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was
probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged
correctly.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Having left the house, I proceeded to do what &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt; had neglected. I
telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry
to the circumstances connected with the marriage of &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch Drebber&lt;/person&gt;. The
answer was conclusive. It told me that &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt; had already applied for
the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson&lt;/person&gt;
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt;, and that this same &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt; was at present in Europe. I knew now that
I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to
secure the murderer.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked
into the house with &lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Drebber&lt;/person&gt;, was none other than the man who had driven
the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on
in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in
charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside
the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry
out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third
person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to
dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to
turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible
conclusion that &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Jefferson Hope&lt;/person&gt; was to be found among the jarveys of the
Metropolis.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased
to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would
be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time
at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to
suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change
his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore
organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically
to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that
I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of
it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Stangerson&lt;/person&gt; was
an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in
any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into
possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.
You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break
or flaw.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is wonderful!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Your merits should be publicly recognized.
You should publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will for
you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You may do what you like, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;See here!&lt;/quote&gt; he
continued, handing a paper over to me, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;look at this!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed
was devoted to the case in question.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The public,&lt;/quote&gt; it said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;have lost a sensational treat through the
sudden death of the man &lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt;, who was suspected of the murder of Mr.
&lt;person perName="Enoch_J_Drebber"&gt;Enoch Drebber&lt;/person&gt; and of &lt;person perName="Joseph_Stangerson"&gt;Mr. Joseph Stangerson&lt;/person&gt;. The details of the case
will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good
authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic
feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the
victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and
&lt;person perName="Jefferson_Hope"&gt;Hope&lt;/person&gt;, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the
case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most
striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will
serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle
their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an
open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to
the well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Tobias_Gregson"&gt;Gregson&lt;/person&gt;.
The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr.
Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in
the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to
attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial
of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting
recognition of their services.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Didn’t I tell you so when we started?&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; with a
laugh. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That’s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a
testimonial!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Never mind,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have all the facts in my journal, and the
public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself
contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser—
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;storyTitle&gt;A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;section number="I"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
akin to love for &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt;. All emotions, and that one particularly,
were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for
drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained
reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene
Adler&lt;/person&gt;, of dubious and questionable memory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had seen little of &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; lately. My marriage had drifted us away
from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
while &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian
soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old
books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen
nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,
and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his
summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and
finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of
the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a
journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered
door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a
keen desire to see &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; again, and to know how he was employing his
extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I
looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own
story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created
dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell
and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,
to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire
and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Wedlock suits you,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that you have put
on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Seven!&lt;/quote&gt; I answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
fancy, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
that you intended to go into harness.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then, how do you know?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
servant girl?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My dear &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;this is too much. You would certainly have
been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a
country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I
have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary
Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,
again, I fail to see how you work it out.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is simplicity itself,&lt;/quote&gt; said he; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;my eyes tell me that on the inside
of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is
scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by
someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in
order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double
deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a
particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As
to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of
iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right
forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where
he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not
pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;When I hear you give your reasons,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked,
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I
could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I
believe that my eyes are as good as yours.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
down into an armchair. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You see, but you do not observe. The
distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps
which lead up from the hall to this room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Frequently.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How often?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Well, some hundreds of times.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then how many are there?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How many? I don’t know.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these
little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.&lt;/quote&gt; He threw
over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open
upon the table. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It came by the last post,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Read it aloud.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,&lt;/quote&gt; it
said, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very
deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of
Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
wear a mask.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;This is indeed a mystery,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What do you imagine that it
means?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has
data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from
it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
written.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked,
endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Such paper could not
be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and
stiff.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Peculiar—that is the very word,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is not an English
paper at all. Hold it up to the light.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G"
with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you make of that?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’
which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like
our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us
glance at our Continental Gazetteer.&lt;/quote&gt; He took down a heavy brown volume
from his shelves. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a
German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable
as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of
that?&lt;/quote&gt; His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud
from his cigarette.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The paper was made in Bohemia,&lt;/quote&gt; I said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the
peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from
all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written
that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only
remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who
writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his
face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our
doubts.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating
wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
whistled.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;A pair, by the sound,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, glancing out of
the window. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred
and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, if there
is nothing else.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I think that I had better go, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But your client—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the
passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and
authoritative tap.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Come in!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches
in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich
with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad
taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and
fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was
thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and
secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming
beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were
trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of
barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He
carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard
mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand
was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face
he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length
of obstinacy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;You had my note?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
marked German accent. &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I told you that I would call.&lt;/quote&gt; He looked from
one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray take a seat,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is my friend and colleague, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr.
Watson&lt;/person&gt;, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom
have I the honour to address?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;You may address me as the &lt;person perName="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Count Von Kramm&lt;/person&gt;, a Bohemian nobleman. I
understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and
discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme
importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you
alone.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rose to go, but &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into
my chair. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is both, or none,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You may say before this
gentleman anything which you may say to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Then I must begin,&lt;/quote&gt; said he,
&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of
that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too
much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
European history.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I promise,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And I.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;You will excuse this mask,&lt;/quote&gt; continued our strange visitor. &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;The august
person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may
confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is
not exactly my own.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I was aware of it,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; dryly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak
plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary
kings of Bohemia.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I was also aware of that,&lt;/quote&gt; murmured &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, settling himself down in
his armchair and closing his eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the
most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I
should be better able to advise you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore
the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;You are right,&lt;/quote&gt;
he cried; &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why, indeed?&lt;/quote&gt; murmured &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your Majesty had not spoken before I
was aware that I was addressing &lt;person perName="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von
Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of
Bohemia&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;But you can understand,&lt;/quote&gt; said our strange visitor, sitting down once
more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;you can
understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to
an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_
from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then, pray consult,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, shutting his eyes once more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy
visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,
&lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt;. The name is no doubt familiar to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; murmured &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; without
opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing
all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to
name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between
that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a
monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Let me see!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.
Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!
Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your
Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,
wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting
those letters back.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Precisely so. But how—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was there a secret marriage?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;None.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No legal papers or certificates?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;None.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to
prove their authenticity?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;There is the writing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pooh, pooh! Forgery.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;My private note-paper.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Stolen.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;My own seal.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Imitated.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;My photograph.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Bought.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;We were both in the photograph.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
indiscretion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I was mad—insane.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have compromised yourself seriously.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It must be recovered.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;We have tried and failed.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;She will not sell.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Stolen, then.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has
been waylaid. There has been no result.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No sign of it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Absolutely none.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; laughed. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is quite a pretty little problem,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;But a very serious one to me,&lt;/quote&gt; returned the King reproachfully.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;To ruin me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But how?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I am about to be married.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So I have heard.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;To &lt;person perName="Clotilde_Lothman"&gt;Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of
Scandinavia&lt;/person&gt;. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is
herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
would bring the matter to an end.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that
she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She
has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no
lengths to which she would not go—none.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are sure that she has not sent it yet?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I am sure.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And why?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, then we have three days yet,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; with a yawn. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is
very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into
just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the
present?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the &lt;person perName="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Count
Von Kramm&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then, as to money?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;You have _carte blanche_.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Absolutely?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to
have that photograph.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And for present expenses?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid
it on the table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,&lt;/quote&gt; he
said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it
to him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And Mademoiselle’s address?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; took a note of it. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One other question,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was the
photograph a cabinet?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;It was.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have
some good news for you. And good-night, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he added, as the
wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If you will be
good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like
to chat this little matter over with you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section number="II"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had not
yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house
shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,
however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.
I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was
surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were
associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,
the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a
character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the
investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which
made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very
possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and
disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my
friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three
times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he
vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his
pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed
heartily for some minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, really!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he
was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What is it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed
my morning, or what I ended by doing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and
perhaps the house, of &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Miss Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.
I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the
character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and
freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all
that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_
villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to
the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on
the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,
and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could
open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and
examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting
anything else of interest.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there
was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent
the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in
exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,
and as much information as I could desire about &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Miss Adler&lt;/person&gt;, to say
nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was
not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to
listen to.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And what of &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the
daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives
out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom
goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male
visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,
never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey
Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a
confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,
and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I
began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think
over my plan of campaign.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.
He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between
them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,
his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably
transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less
likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should
continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the
gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it
widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these
details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
to understand the situation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I am following you closely,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up
to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably
handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom
I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman
to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of
a man who was thoroughly at home.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of
him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking
excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently
he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to
the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it
earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &amp;
Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the
Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well
to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all
the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t
pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only
caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with
a face that a man might die for.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if
you reach it in twenty minutes.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This was quite too good to lose, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. I was just balancing whether
I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a
cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby
fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.
Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty
minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was
clear enough what was in the wind.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others
were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses
were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried
into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had
followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I
lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘What then?’ I asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I
found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in
the secure tying up of &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt;, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,
bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman
thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the
clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position
in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it
that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some
informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused
to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky
appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the
streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I
mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,&lt;/quote&gt; said I; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;and what then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the
pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt
and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they
separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I
shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left
him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I
went off to make my own arrangements.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Which are?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Some cold beef and a glass of beer,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered, ringing the bell. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I
have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still
this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I shall be delighted.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You don’t mind breaking the law?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Not in the least.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nor running a chance of arrest?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Not in a good cause.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, the cause is excellent!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then I am your man.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I was sure that I might rely on you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But what is it you wish?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;When &lt;person perName="Mrs_Turner"&gt;Mrs. Turner&lt;/person&gt; has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.
Now,&lt;/quote&gt; he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our
landlady had provided, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not
much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene
of action. &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Miss Irene&lt;/person&gt;, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at
seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And what then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.
There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,
come what may. You understand?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I am to be neutral?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed
into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window
will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give
you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You
quite follow me?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Entirely.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is nothing very formidable,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
roll from his pocket. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted
with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is
confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up
by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the
street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made
myself clear?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at
the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and
to wait you at the corner of the street.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then you may entirely rely on me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare
for the new role I have to play.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the
character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His
broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic
smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such
as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul
seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a
fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a
specialist in crime.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine
Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as
we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming
of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be
less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a
quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of
shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
down with cigars in their mouths.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You see,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, as we paced to and fro in front of the
house, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes
a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse
to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming
to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find
the photograph?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Where, indeed?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet
size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows
that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two
attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that
she does not carry it about with her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Where, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am
inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like
to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?
She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what
indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a
business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within
a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be
in her own house.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But it has twice been burgled.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pshaw! They did not know how to look.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But how will you look?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I will not look.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I will get her to show me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But she will refuse.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her
carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the
curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to
the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at
the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a
copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with
the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by
the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the
scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was
struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,
was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,
he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely
down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one
direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better
dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,
crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene
Adler&lt;/person&gt;, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she
stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of
the hall, looking back into the street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Irene_Adler"&gt;Is the poor gentleman much hurt?&lt;/quote&gt; she asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;He is dead,&lt;/quote&gt; cried several voices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;No, no, there’s life in him!&lt;/quote&gt; shouted another. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;But he’ll be gone
before you can get him to hospital.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;He’s a brave fellow,&lt;/quote&gt; said a woman. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;They would have had the lady’s
purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a
rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.
This way, please!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the
principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by
the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,
so that I could see &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as he lay upon the couch. I do not know
whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he
was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of
myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I
was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon
the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened
my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I
thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from
injuring another.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who
is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At
the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my
rocket into the room with a cry of &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Fire!&lt;/quote&gt; The word was no sooner out
of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and
ill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of
&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Fire!&lt;/quote&gt; Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the
open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later
the voice of &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; from within assuring them that it was a false
alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm
in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly
and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the
quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You did it very nicely, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nothing could have been
better. It is all right.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You have the photograph?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I know where it is.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And how did you find out?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;She showed me, as I told you she would.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I am still in the dark.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I do not wish to make a mystery,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The matter was
perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was
an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I guessed as much.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the
palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my
face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That also I could fathom.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could
she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I
suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to
see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were
compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How did that help you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,
her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It
is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken
advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it
was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married
woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house
more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to
secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting
were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right
bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as
she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she
replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have
not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the
house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;
but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it
seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And now?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown
into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that
when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be
a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And when will you call?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a
clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a
complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without
delay.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Good-night, Mister &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting
appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I’ve heard that voice before,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, staring down the dimly lit
street. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section number="III"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast
and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the
room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;You have really got it!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, grasping &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; by either
shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not yet.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;But you have hopes?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have hopes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We must have a cab.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;No, my brougham is waiting.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then that will simplify matters.&lt;/quote&gt; We descended and started off once
more for Briony Lodge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt; is married,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Married! When?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yesterday.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;But to whom?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;To an English lawyer named Norton.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;But she could not love him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am in hopes that she does.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;And why in hopes?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If
the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does
not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with
your Majesty’s plan.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!
What a queen she would have made!&lt;/quote&gt; He relapsed into a moody silence,
which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the
steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
brougham.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, I believe?&lt;/quote&gt; said she.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; answered my companion, looking at her with a
questioning and rather startled gaze.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left
this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for
the Continent.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What!&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; staggered back, white with chagrin and
surprise. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you mean that she has left England?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Never to return.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;And the papers?&lt;/quote&gt; asked the King hoarsely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;All is lost.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We shall see.&lt;/quote&gt; He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open
drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,
plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The
photograph was of &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt; herself in evening dress, the letter was
superscribed to &lt;quote spokeBy="Irene_Adler"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, Esq. To be left till called for.&lt;/quote&gt; My
friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Irene_Adler"&gt;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took
me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly
be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you
made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old
clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the
freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,
ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came
down just as you departed.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Irene_Adler"&gt;Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
really an object of interest to the celebrated &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for
the Temple to see my husband.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Irene_Adler"&gt;We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so
formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you
call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do
what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
possess; and I remain, dear &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Irene_Adler"&gt;Very truly yours,
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Irene_Adler"&gt;IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;What a woman—oh, what a woman!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the King of Bohemia, when we had
all three read this epistle. &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Did I not tell you how quick and resolute
she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity
that she was not on my level?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very
different level to your Majesty,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; coldly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am sorry that
I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more
successful conclusion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;On the contrary, my dear sir,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the King; &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;nothing could be more
successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as
safe as if it were in the fire.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward
you. This ring—&lt;/quote&gt; He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and
held it out upon the palm of his hand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,&lt;/quote&gt;
said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;You have but to name it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This photograph!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The King stared at him in amazement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;&lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene&lt;/person&gt;’s photograph!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="Wilhelm_Ormstein"&gt;Certainly, if you wish it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.
I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.&lt;/quote&gt; He bowed, and,
turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched
out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of
Bohemia, and how the best plans of &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; were beaten by a
woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I
have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt;, or
when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable
title of _the_ woman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="II"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt; I had called upon my friend, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, one day in the
 autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very
 stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an
 apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; pulled
 me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he
said cordially.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I was afraid that you were engaged.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So I am. Very much so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then I can wait in the next room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not at all. This gentleman, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;, has been my partner and helper
in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will
be of the utmost use to me in yours also.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
fat-encircled eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Try the settee,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, relapsing into his armchair and putting
his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I
know, my dear &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and
outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have
shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to
chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish
so many of my own little adventures.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,&lt;/quote&gt; I
observed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went
into the very simple problem presented by &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Mary Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;, that
for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life
itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the
imagination.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for
otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your
reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr.
Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt; here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,
and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular
which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that
the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with
the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where
there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.
As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the
present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events
is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
Perhaps, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;, you would have the great kindness to recommence
your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt; has
not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the
story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As
a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of
events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar
cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to
admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside
pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,
with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,
I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my
companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his
dress or appearance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore
every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,
pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers,
a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab
waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of
metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown
overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man
save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
discontent upon his features.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head
with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Beyond the obvious
facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,
that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done
a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt; started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the
paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
he asked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.
It’s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than
your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
developed.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use
an arc-and-compass breastpin.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five
inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you
rest it upon the desk?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Well, but China?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist
could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo
marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That
trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite
peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from
your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt; laughed heavily. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Well, I never!&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I thought
at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was
nothing in it after all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I begin to think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that I make a mistake in
explaining. ‘_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,’ you know, and my poor
little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so
candid. Can you not find the advertisement, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Yes, I have got it now,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered with his thick red finger planted
  halfway down the column. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Here it is. This is what began it all. You
just read it for yourself, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the paper from him and read as follows:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late
Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another
vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £ 4 a
week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in
body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.
Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the
offices of the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What on earth does this mean?&lt;/quote&gt; I ejaculated after I had twice read
over the extraordinary announcement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in
high spirits. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;, off you go at scratch and tell us all about
yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had
upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper
and the date.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very good. Now, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Well, it is just as I have been telling you, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt;
  said &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt;, mopping his forehead; &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I have a small pawnbroker’s
business at Coburg Square, near the City. It’s not a very large affair,
and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I
used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I
would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half
wages so as to learn the business.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What is the name of this obliging youth?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s
hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;;
and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I
am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I
put ideas in his head?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes
under the full market price. It is not a common experience among
employers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as
remarkable as your advertisement.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Oh, he has his faults, too,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Never was such a fellow
for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be
improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit
into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on
the whole he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He is still with you, I presume?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking
and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a
widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three
of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do
nothing more.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he
came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very
paper in his hand, and he says:
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘I wish to the Lord, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;, that I was a red-headed man.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Why that?’ I asks.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the
Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets
it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,
so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.
If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all
ready for me to step into.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, I am a very
stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to
go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the
door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,
and I was always glad of a bit of news.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked
with his eyes open.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Never.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the
vacancies.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it
need not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the
business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of
hundred would have been very handy.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for
yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where
you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League
was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very
peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great
sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he
had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with
instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to
men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay
and very little to do.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would
apply.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really
confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from
London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.
Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is
light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery
red. Now, if you cared to apply, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;, you would just walk in;
but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of
the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my
hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if
there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance
as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so
much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered
him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.
He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and
started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I never hope to see such a sight as that again, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. From
north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his
hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet
Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a
coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in
the whole country as were brought together by that single
advertisement. Every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange,
brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were
not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how
many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding
would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed
and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon
the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we
wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your experience has been a most entertaining one,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as
his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray continue your very interesting statement.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a
deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even
redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,
and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would
disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy
matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much
more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door
as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘This is &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt;,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to
fill a vacancy in the League.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every
requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He
took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair
until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my
hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am
sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized
my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.
‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘I perceive
that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have
twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales
of cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped
over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that
the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was
not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the
pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a
married man, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;? Have you a family?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I answered that I had not.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;His face fell immediately.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry
to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and
spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is
exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;My face lengthened at this, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, for I thought that I was not
to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few
minutes he said that it would be all right.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but
we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as
yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Oh, never mind about that, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I
should be able to look after that for you.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Ten to two.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,
especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;
so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see
to anything that turned up.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Is £ 4 a week.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘And the work?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Is purely nominal.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘What do you call purely nominal?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the
whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The
will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the
conditions if you budge from the office during that time.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said
I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross; ‘neither sickness nor
business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your
billet.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘And the work?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Is to copy out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. There is the first
volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready
to-morrow?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Certainly,’ I answered.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Then, good-bye, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt;, and let me congratulate you once
more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to
gain.’ He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,
hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good
fortune.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low
spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair
must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I
could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could
make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything
so simple as copying out the _Encyclopædia Britannica_. Vincent
Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had
reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I
determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of
ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I
started off for Pope’s Court.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.
The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to
see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and
then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all
was right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me
upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office
after me.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;This went on day after day, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and on Saturday the manager
came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;To an end?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I cannot see that there is anything very funny,&lt;/quote&gt; cried our client,
  flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;If you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, no,&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘What, the red-headed man?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Yes.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Where could I find him?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
Edward Street, near St. Paul’s.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I started off, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And what did you do then?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And you did very wisely,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Grave enough!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Why, I have lost four pound a
week.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;As far as you are personally concerned,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;About a month then.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How did he come?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;In answer to an advertisement.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was he the only applicant?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;No, I had a dozen.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why did you pick him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Because he was handy and would come cheap.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;At half wages, in fact.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I thought as
much,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hum!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, sinking back in deep thought. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He is still with
you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And has your business been attended to in your absence?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a
morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That will do, &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; when our visitor had left us, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;what do you
make of it all?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I make nothing of it,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered frankly. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is a most mysterious
business.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;As a rule,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;the more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What are you going to do, then?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;To smoke,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.&lt;/quote&gt; He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;? Could your patients spare you for a few
hours?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and
we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal
of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than
Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come
along!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk
took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we
had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel
place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out
into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few
clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden
and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
"JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the
place where our red-headed client carried on his business. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt; stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it
all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he
walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still
looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,
and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or
three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly
opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to
step in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I only wished to ask you how you would go
from here to the Strand.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Third right, fourth left,&lt;/quote&gt; answered the assistant promptly, closing
the door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Smart fellow, that,&lt;/quote&gt; observed &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as we walked away. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He is, in my
judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not
sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him
before.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Evidently,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;&lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Wilson&lt;/person&gt;’s assistant counts for a good deal in
this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your
way merely in order that you might see him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The knees of his trousers.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And what did you see?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What I expected to see.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why did you beat the pavement?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are
spies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.
Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from
the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as
the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main
arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.
The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in
a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with
the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we
looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that
they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant
square which we had just quitted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Let me see,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, standing at the corner and glancing along
the line, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.
It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is
Mortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg
branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and
McFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the
other block. And now, Doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had
some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,
where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very
capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the
afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,
gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his
gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those
of &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; the sleuth-hound, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; the relentless, keen-witted,
ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his
singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his
extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,
the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which
occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never
so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in
his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.
Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,
and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of
intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would
look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other
mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.
James’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom
he had set himself to hunt down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked as we emerged.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes, it would be as well.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
business at Coburg Square is serious.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why serious?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday
rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;At what time?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ten will be early enough.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I shall be at Baker Street at ten.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so
kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.&lt;/quote&gt; He waved his hand,
turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always
oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had
seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not
only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the
whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my
house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story
of the red-headed copier of the _Encyclopædia_ down to the visit to
Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from
me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
that this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a
man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it
up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an
explanation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way
across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two
hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard
the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; in
animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter
Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,
sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable
frock-coat.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ha! Our party is complete,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, buttoning up his pea-jacket
and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, I think you
know &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Mr. Jones&lt;/person&gt;, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr.
Merryweather&lt;/person&gt;, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;We’re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt; in his
consequential way. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a
chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,&lt;/quote&gt;
observed &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt; gloomily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;You may place considerable confidence in &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; said the
police agent loftily. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;He has his own little methods, which are, if he
won’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,
but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say
that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the
Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official
force.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;Oh, if you say so, &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Mr. Jones&lt;/person&gt;, it is all right,&lt;/quote&gt; said the stranger with
deference. &lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first
Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my
rubber.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think you will find,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that you will play for
a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play
will be more exciting. For you, &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt;, the stake will be
some £ 30,000; and for you, &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt;, it will be the man upon whom you
wish to lay your hands.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Clay"&gt;John Clay&lt;/person&gt;, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,
&lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt;, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would
rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a
remarkable man, is young &lt;person perName="John_Clay"&gt;John Clay&lt;/person&gt;. His grandfather was a royal duke,
and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as
his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never
know where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one
week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
I’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve
had one or two little turns also with &lt;person perName="John_Clay"&gt;Mr. John Clay&lt;/person&gt;, and I agree with
you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,
and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,
&lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt; and I will follow in the second.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was not very communicative during the long drive and
lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the
afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
until we emerged into Farrington Street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We are close there now,&lt;/quote&gt; my friend remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This fellow &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Merryweather&lt;/person&gt;
is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought
it as well to have &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt; with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though
an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He
is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his
claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found
ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the
guidance of &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt;, we passed down a narrow passage and
through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small
corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was
opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated
at another formidable gate. &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt; stopped to light a
lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and
so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was
piled all round with crates and massive boxes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are not very vulnerable from above,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; remarked as he held up
the lantern and gazed about him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;Nor from below,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt;, striking his stick upon the
flags which lined the floor. &lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!&lt;/quote&gt; he
remarked, looking up in surprise.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
severely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have already imperilled the whole success of our
expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down
upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solemn &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt; perched himself upon a crate, with a very
injured expression upon his face, while &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; fell upon his knees upon
the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine
minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to
satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his
pocket.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We have at least an hour before us,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;for they can hardly
take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they
will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer
time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor—as no
doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the City branch of one of the
principal London banks. &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt; is the chairman of directors,
and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring
criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar
at present.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;It is our French gold,&lt;/quote&gt; whispered the director. &lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;We have had several
warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your French gold?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and
borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It
has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,
and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit
contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our
reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a
single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the
subject.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Which were very well justified,&lt;/quote&gt; observed &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now it is time
that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters
will come to a head. In the meantime &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt;, we must put the
screen over that dark lantern.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;And sit in the dark?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I
thought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber
after all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far
that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must
choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take
them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind
those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they
fire, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, have no compunction about shooting them down.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind
which I crouched. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; shot the slide across the front of his lantern
and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as I have never
before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that
the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. To
me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was
something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold
dank air of the vault.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They have but one retreat,&lt;/quote&gt; whispered &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is back through
the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I
asked you, &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and
wait.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an
hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have
almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and
stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up
to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I
could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could
distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt; from the
thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look
over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught
the glint of a light.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it
lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any
warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,
almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area
of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,
protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it
appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which
marked a chink between the stones.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing
sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and
left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a
lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which
looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the
aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee
rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the
hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like
himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;It’s all clear,&lt;/quote&gt; he whispered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;Have you the chisel and the bags?
Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.
The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth
as &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt; clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a
revolver, but &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and
the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s no use, &lt;person perName="John_Clay"&gt;John Clay&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; blandly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have no chance at
all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;So I see,&lt;/quote&gt; the other answered with the utmost coolness. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;I fancy that
my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There are three men waiting for him at the door,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must
compliment you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And I you,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your red-headed idea was very new and
effective.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;You’ll see your pal again presently,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;He’s quicker at
climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked our
prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;You may not be
aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,
when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;All right,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Jones"&gt;Jones&lt;/person&gt; with a stare and a snigger. &lt;quote spokeBy="Jones"&gt;Well, would you
please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your
Highness to the police-station?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Clay"&gt;That is better,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="John_Clay"&gt;John Clay&lt;/person&gt; serenely. He made a sweeping bow to
the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;Really, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Merryweather"&gt;Mr. Merryweather&lt;/person&gt; as we followed them from
the cellar, &lt;quote spokeBy="Merryweather"&gt;I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.
There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most
complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
that have ever come within my experience.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with &lt;person perName="John_Clay"&gt;Mr. John
Clay&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have been at some small expense over this
matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am
amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,
and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You see, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he explained in the early hours of the morning as we
sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;it was perfectly
obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather
fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying
of the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker
out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of
managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.
The method was no doubt suggested to&lt;person perName="John_Clay"&gt; Clay&lt;/person&gt;’s ingenious mind by the
colour of his accomplice’s hair. The £ 4 a week was a lure which must
draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They
put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other
rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to
secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I
heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me
that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But how could you guess what the motive was?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere
vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s
business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which
could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure
as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What
could it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and
his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end
of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious
assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most
daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the
cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What
could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was
running a tunnel to some other building.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It
was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant
answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes
upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were
what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn,
wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of
burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I
walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our
friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you
drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the
chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?&lt;/quote&gt; I
asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they
cared no longer about &lt;person perName="Jabez_Wilson"&gt;Mr. Jabez Wilson&lt;/person&gt;’s presence—in other words, that
they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should
use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be
removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it
would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I
expected them to come to-night.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You reasoned it out beautifully,&lt;/quote&gt; I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.
&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It saved me from ennui,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered, yawning. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Alas! I already feel
it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape
from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do
so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And you are a benefactor of the race,&lt;/quote&gt; said I.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He shrugged his shoulders. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some
little use,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘_L’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout_,’
as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="III"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;A CASE OF IDENTITY&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My dear fellow,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as we sat on either side of the
fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;life is infinitely stranger than
anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to
conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If
we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great
city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which
are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the
cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through
generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all
fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale
and unprofitable.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And yet I am not convinced of it,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The cases which come
to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.
We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and
yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor
artistic.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
realistic effect,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is wanting in the police
report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the
magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the
vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so
unnatural as the commonplace.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled and shook my head. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I can quite understand your thinking so,&lt;/quote&gt;
I said. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper
to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But
here&lt;/quote&gt;—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;let us put it to a
practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A
husband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but I
know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There
is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers
could invent nothing more crude.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,&lt;/quote&gt; said
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is the
Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing
up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a
teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was
that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking
out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will
allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the
average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge
that I have scored over you in your example.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the
centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely
ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is
a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance
in the case of the &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt; papers.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And the ring?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
sparkled upon his finger.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which
I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to
you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little
problems.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And have you any on hand just now?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked with interest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.
They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,
I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a
field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and
effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are
apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a
rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate
matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that
I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this
is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds
gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over
his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large
woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red
feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess
of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she
peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her
body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her
glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of
the bell.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have seen those symptoms before,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, throwing his
cigarette into the fire. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oscillation upon the pavement always means an
_affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the
matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may
discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no
longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we
may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so
much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to
resolve our doubts.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered
to announce &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Mary Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;, while the lady herself loomed behind
his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny
pilot boat. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into
an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted
fashion which was peculiar to him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you not find,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that with your short sight it is a little
trying to do so much typewriting?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;I did at first,&lt;/quote&gt; she answered, &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;but now I know where the letters are
without looking.&lt;/quote&gt; Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his
words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and
astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;You’ve heard about
me, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; she cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;else how could you know all that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Never mind,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;it is my business to know things.
Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why
should you come to consult me?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose
husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up
for dead. Oh, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m not
rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the
little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what
has become of &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Mary
Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Yes, I did bang out of the house,&lt;/quote&gt; she said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;for it made
me angry to see the easy way in which &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;—that is, my
father—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go
to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that
there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things
and came right away to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your father,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;your stepfather, surely, since the name is
different.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,
for he is only five years and two months older than myself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And your mother is alive?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,
when she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was
nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the
Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which
mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;
came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a
traveller in wines. They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,
which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been
alive.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had expected to see &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; impatient under this rambling and
inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with
the greatest concentration of attention.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your own little income,&lt;/quote&gt; he asked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;does it come out of the business?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in
Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand
five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You interest me extremely,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And since you draw so large
a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no
doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that
a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;I could do with much less than that, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, but you understand
that as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and
so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of
course, that is only just for the time. &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt; draws my interest
every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do
pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a
sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have made your position very clear to me,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is
my friend, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt;, before whom you can speak as freely as before
myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer
Angel&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flush stole over &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;’s face, and she picked nervously at
the fringe of her jacket. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,&lt;/quote&gt;
she said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then
afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;
did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would
get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But
this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
father’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit
to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken
out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to
France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with
Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr.
Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I suppose,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;that when &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt; came back from
France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a
woman, for she would have her way.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a
gentleman called &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we
had got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr.
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back
again, and &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt; could not come to the house any more.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t
have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman
should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to
mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got
mine yet.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But how about &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;? Did he make no attempt to see you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer&lt;/person&gt; wrote
and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until
he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every
day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for
father to know.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Oh, yes, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. We were engaged after the first walk that we
took. &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer&lt;/person&gt;—&lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Angel&lt;/person&gt;—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall
Street—and—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What office?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;That’s the worst of it, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, I don’t know.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Where did he live, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;He slept on the premises.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And you don’t know his address?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Where did you address your letters, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He
said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all
the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to
typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said
that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were
typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That
will just show you how fond he was of me, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and the little
things that he would think of.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It was most suggestive,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It has long been an axiom of
mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you
remember any other little things about &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;He was a very shy man, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. He would rather walk with me in the
evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be
conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was
gentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he
told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,
whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and
plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted
glasses against the glare.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, and what happened when &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;, your stepfather, returned
to France?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;&lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt; came to the house again and proposed that we should
marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me
swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would
always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,
and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour
from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they
talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but
they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him
afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I
didn’t quite like that, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. It seemed funny that I should ask
his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want
to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the
very morning of the wedding.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It missed him, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the
Friday. Was it to be in church?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s
Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras
Hotel. &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer&lt;/person&gt; came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he
put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which
happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church
first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step
out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and
looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not
imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own
eyes. That was last Friday, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and I have never seen or heard
anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,&lt;/quote&gt; said
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the
morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;
and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I
was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would
claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a
wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not
have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But you have no notion as to what it could have been?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;None.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One more question. How did your mother take the matter?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
again.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And your father? Did you tell him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and
that I should hear of &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer&lt;/person&gt; again. As he said, what interest could
anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving
me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got
my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer&lt;/person&gt; was
very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of
mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?
Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can’t sleep a wink at
night.&lt;/quote&gt; She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to
sob heavily into it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I shall glance into the case for you,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, rising, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;and I
have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight
of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it
further. Above all, try to let &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt; vanish from your
memory, as he has done from your life.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I fear not.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Then what has happened to him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate
description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;I advertised for him in last Saturday’s _Chronicle_,&lt;/quote&gt; said she. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Here
is the slip and here are four letters from him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you. And your address?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Angel&lt;/person&gt;’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your
father’s place of business?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;He travels for Westhouse &amp; Marbank, the great claret importers of
Fenchurch Street.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave
the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let
the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your
life.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;You are very kind, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, but I cannot do that. I shall be true
to &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer&lt;/person&gt;. He shall find me ready when he comes back.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something
noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.
She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,
with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still
pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze
directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old
and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit
it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths
spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite an interesting study, that maiden,&lt;/quote&gt; he observed. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I found her
more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather
a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in
Andover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last
year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which
were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to
me,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not invisible but unnoticed, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. You did not know where to look,
and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to
realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,
or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you
gather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn
upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was
brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at
the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at
the right forefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small round,
hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in
a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;’Pon my word, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you
have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my
boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always
at a woman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the
knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her
sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double
line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against
the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand
type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing
the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark
upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It surprised me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested
on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was
wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one
having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was
buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at
the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady,
otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,
half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a
hurry.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And what else?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my
friend’s incisive reasoning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home
but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was
torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove
and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and
dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark
would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though
rather elementary, but I must go back to business, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. Would you
mind reading me the advertised description of &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I held the little printed slip to the light. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Missing,&lt;/quote&gt; it said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;on
the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;. About
five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black
hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and
moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed,
when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,
gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters
over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in
Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing,&lt;/quote&gt; &amp;c, &amp;c.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That will do,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;As to the letters,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued,
glancing over them, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in
them to &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Angel&lt;/person&gt;, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one
remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;They are typewritten,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat
little ‘&lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no
superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The
point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it
conclusive.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Of what?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears
upon the case?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to
deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which
should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to
the young lady’s stepfather, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;, asking him whether he could
meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that
we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can
do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our
little problem upon the shelf for the interim.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of
reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must
have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which
he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to
fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of
Bohemia and of the &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt; photograph; but when I looked back to
the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary
circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would
be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that
he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity
of the disappearing bridegroom of &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Mary Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at
the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the
sufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself
free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,
half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of
the little mystery. I found &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; alone, however, half
asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his
armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the
pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent
his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Well, have you solved it?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked as I entered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;No, no, the mystery!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There
was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some
of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no
law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss
Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question was hardly out of my mouth, and &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had not yet opened
his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a
tap at the door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is the girl’s stepfather, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. James Windibank&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He
has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty
years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,
insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating
grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny
top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the
nearest chair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Good-evening, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. James Windibank&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that this
typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with
me for six o’clock?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my
own master, you know. I am sorry that &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Sutherland&lt;/person&gt; has troubled you
about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash
linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she
came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have
noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind
on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not
connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a
family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
expense, for how could you possibly find this &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On the contrary,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; quietly; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have every reason to believe
that I will succeed in discovering &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt; gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;I am
delighted to hear it,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a curious thing,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that a typewriter has really
quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they are
quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more
worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in
this note of yours, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;, that in every case there is some
little slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the
‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more
obvious.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no
doubt it is a little worn,&lt;/quote&gt; our visitor answered, glancing keenly at
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; with his bright little eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr.
Windibank&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; continued. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think of writing another little
monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to
crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I
have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They
are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and
the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my
magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I
have alluded are there as well.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt; sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;I cannot
waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;If
you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done
it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Certainly,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, stepping over and turning the key in the
door. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I let you know, then, that I have caught him!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;What! where?&lt;/quote&gt; shouted &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;, turning white to his lips and
glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; suavely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is no
possible getting out of it, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;. It is quite too transparent,
and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible
for me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down and let us
talk it over.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter
of moisture on his brow. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;It—it’s not actionable,&lt;/quote&gt; he stammered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty
way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of
events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
breast, like one who is utterly crushed. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; stuck his feet up on
the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his
pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,&lt;/quote&gt;
said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long
as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their
position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It
was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable
disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it
was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little
income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her
marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what
does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of
her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She
became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her
positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever
stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head
than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he
disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked
the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear
voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
girl’s short sight, he appears as &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;, and keeps off other
lovers by making love himself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;It was only a joke at first,&lt;/quote&gt; groaned our visitor. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;We never thought
that she would have been so carried away.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her
stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an
instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s
attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed
admiration of her mother. Then &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Angel&lt;/person&gt; began to call, for it was
obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a
real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an
engagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from
turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up
forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The
thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a
dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the
young lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor
for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a
Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something
happening on the very morning of the wedding. &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;James Windibank&lt;/person&gt; wished
&lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Sutherland&lt;/person&gt; to be so bound to &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Hosmer Angel&lt;/person&gt;, and so uncertain as to
his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen
to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as
he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I
think that was the chain of events, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. Windibank&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had
been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his
pale face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;It may be so, or it may not, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Windibank"&gt;but if you are so
very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are
breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from
the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself
open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The law cannot, as you say, touch you,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, unlocking and
throwing open the door, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;yet there never was a man who deserved
punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought
to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, flushing
up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;it is not
part of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I
think I shall just treat myself to—&lt;/quote&gt; He took two swift steps to the
whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps
upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we
could see &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;Mr. James Windibank&lt;/person&gt; running at the top of his speed down the
road.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing, as he threw
himself down into his chair once more. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That fellow will rise from
crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.
The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,&lt;/quote&gt; I
remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this &lt;person perName="Hosmer_Angel"&gt;Mr. Hosmer
Angel&lt;/person&gt; must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was
equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as
far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men
were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other
was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious
voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his
signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so
familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of
it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,
all pointed in the same direction.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And how did you verify them?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew
the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result
of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to
the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered
to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed
the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at
his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected,
his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
Westhouse &amp; Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description
tallied in every respect with that of their employé, &lt;person perName="James_Windibank"&gt;James Windibank&lt;/person&gt;.
_Voilà tout_!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
Persian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and
danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as
much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="IV"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid
brought in a telegram. It was from &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; and ran in this way:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the
west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be
glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave
Paddington by the 11:15.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;What do you say, dear?&lt;/quote&gt; said my wife, looking across at me. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;Will you
go?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
present.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a
little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you
are always so interested in &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ cases.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one
of them,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I
have only half an hour.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect
of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and
simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my
valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was pacing
up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and
taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is really very good of you to come, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It makes a
considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can
thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.
If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers
which &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,
with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past
Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and
tossed them up onto the rack.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you heard anything of the case?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been
looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple
cases which are so extremely difficult.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That sounds a little paradoxical.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue.
The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it
is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a
very serious case against the son of the murdered man.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is a murder, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted
until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will
explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to
understand it, in a very few words.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Mr. John
Turner&lt;/person&gt;, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to
the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was
let to &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. Charles McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had
known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that
when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as
possible. &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Turner&lt;/person&gt; was apparently the richer man, so &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; became his
tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as
they were frequently together. &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; had one son, a lad of eighteen,
and &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Turner&lt;/person&gt; had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them
had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the
neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though
both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the
race-meetings of the neighbourhood. &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; kept two servants—a man
and a girl. &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Turner&lt;/person&gt; had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
families. Now for the facts.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; left his house at
Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe
Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream
which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his
serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he
must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.
From that appointment he never came back alive.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,
and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old
woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,
a game-keeper in the employ of &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Mr. Turner&lt;/person&gt;. Both these witnesses depose
that &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a
few minutes of his seeing &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; pass he had seen his son, &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;Mr.
James McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the
best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and
the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he
heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the
game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded
round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl
of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of
the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.
She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood
and close by the lake, &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; and his son, and that they appeared
to be having a violent quarrel. She heard &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; the elder using
very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home
that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and
that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said
the words when young &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; came running up to the lodge to say
that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help
of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his
hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with
fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out
upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might
very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which
was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under
these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict
of ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he
was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have
referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the
case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I could hardly imagine a more damning case,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;If ever
circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,&lt;/quote&gt; answered &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
thoughtfully. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if
you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in
an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It
must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave
against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the
culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and
among them &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Miss Turner&lt;/person&gt;, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who
believe in his innocence, and who have retained &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, whom you may
recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case
in his interest. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, being rather puzzled, has referred the case
to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying
westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their
breakfasts at home.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I am afraid,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that the facts are so obvious that you will
find little credit to be gained out of this case.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered,
laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts
which may have been by no means obvious to &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;. You know me
too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either
confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of
employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,
I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the
right-hand side, and yet I question whether &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; would have
noted even so self-evident a thing as that.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How on earth—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which
characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you
shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete
as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively
slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear
that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine
a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being
satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of
observation and inference. Therein lies my _métier_, and it is just
possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies
before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
the inquest, and which are worth considering.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What are they?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the
return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing
him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to
hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of
his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might
have remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It was a confession,&lt;/quote&gt; I ejaculated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least
a most suspicious remark.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On the contrary,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;it is the brightest rift which I can
at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could
not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances
were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own
arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as
highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural
under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to
a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint
and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his
father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far
forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,
according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise
his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which
are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy
mind rather than of a guilty one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shook my head. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,&lt;/quote&gt;
I remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What is the young man’s own account of the matter?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though
there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find
it here, and may read it for yourself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,
and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which
the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had
occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read
it very carefully. It ran in this way:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. James McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;, the only son of the deceased, was then called and
gave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at
Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,
the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and
I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John
Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap
in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk
rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he
was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the
Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which
is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the
game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in
thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in
front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then
hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be
much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was
doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost
to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that
his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards
Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I
heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I
found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly
injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost
instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made
my way to &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Mr. Turner&lt;/person&gt;’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to
ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I
have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,
being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far
as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion
to a rat.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was
delirious.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had
this final quarrel?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you
that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to
you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably
in any future proceedings which may arise.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: I must still refuse.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal
between you and your father?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: It was.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,
and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you
returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: Nothing definite.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;The Coroner: What do you mean?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,
that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague
impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the
left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of
some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked
round for it, but it was gone.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘Yes, it was gone.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;  ‘You cannot say what it was?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘How far from the body?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘A dozen yards or so.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘About the same.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of
it?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This concluded the examination of the witness."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I see,&lt;/quote&gt; said I as I glanced down the column, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that the coroner in his
concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls
attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having
signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details
of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his
father’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against
the son.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the
cushioned seat. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,&lt;/quote&gt;
said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s
favour. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having
too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent
a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too
much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so
_outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the
vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of
view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither
that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of
action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty
minutes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the
beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found
ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,
ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the
platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings
which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no
difficulty in recognising &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove
to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I have ordered a carriage,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; as we sat over a cup of tea.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until
you had been on the scene of the crime.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It was very nice and complimentary of you,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is
entirely a question of barometric pressure.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; looked startled. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I do not quite follow,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the
sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the
sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do
not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; laughed indulgently. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;You have, no doubt, already formed your
conclusions from the newspapers,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;The case is as plain as a
pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,
of course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.
She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly
told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not
already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most
lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes
shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of
her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;Oh, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt; she cried, glancing from one to the other of
us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my
companion, &lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell
you so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to
start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon
that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and
I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to
hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I hope we may clear him, &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Miss Turner&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You may
rely upon my doing all that I can.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do
you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he
is innocent?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that it is very probable.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;There, now!&lt;/quote&gt; she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly
at &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;You hear! He gives me hopes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; shrugged his shoulders. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I am afraid that my colleague has
been a little quick in forming his conclusions,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And
about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he
would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in
it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In what way?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;It is no time for me to hide anything. &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;James&lt;/person&gt; and his father had many
disagreements about me. &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; was very anxious that there should
be a marriage between us. &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;James&lt;/person&gt; and I have always loved each other as
brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little
of life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything
like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of
them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And your father?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was he in favour of such a union?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;No, he was averse to it also. No one but &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; was in favour of
it.&lt;/quote&gt; A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; shot one
of his keen, questioning glances at her.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you for this information,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;May I see your father if I
call to-morrow?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The doctor?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years
back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,
and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is
shattered. &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;Mr. McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; was the only man alive who had known dad in the
old days in Victoria.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ha! In Victoria! That is important.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;Yes, at the mines.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Mr. Turner&lt;/person&gt; made
his money.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;Yes, certainly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you, &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Miss Turner&lt;/person&gt;. You have been of material assistance to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go
to the prison to see &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;James&lt;/person&gt;. Oh, if you do, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, do tell him that
I know him to be innocent.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I will, &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Miss Turner&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alice_Turner"&gt;I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I
leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.&lt;/quote&gt; She hurried
from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the
wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I am ashamed of you, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; with dignity after a few
minutes’ silence. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to
disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that I see my way to clearing &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;James McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you an order to see him in prison?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Yes, but only for you and me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still
time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Ample.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then let us do so. &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, I fear that you will find it very slow, but
I shall only be away a couple of hours.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the
streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay
upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the
deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention
wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung
it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of
the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man’s story
were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the
time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by
his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and
deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal
something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the
weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.
In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of
the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon
my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.
That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen
quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go
for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the
blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ attention to
it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could
that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow
does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an
attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I
cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the
incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true
the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and
to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back
turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and
improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;’s
opinion, and yet I had so much faith in &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ insight that I
could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen
his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was late before &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; returned. He came back alone, for
&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; was staying in lodgings in the town.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The glass still keeps very high,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked as he sat down. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is
of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the
ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest
for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by
a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And what did you learn from him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nothing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Could he throw no light?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had
done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is
as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,
though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot admire his taste,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;if it is indeed a fact that
he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Miss
Turner&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a
lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at
a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of
a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a
word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him
to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,
but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of
this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his
father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Miss
Turner&lt;/person&gt;. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and
his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown
him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife
that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did
not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has
come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him
over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband
already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between
them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; for all
that he has suffered.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But if he is innocent, who has done it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.
One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the
pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was
away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the
murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son had
returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And
now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall
leave all minor matters until to-morrow.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no rain, as &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had foretold, and the morning broke bright
and cloudless. At nine o’clock &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; called for us with the
carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;There is serious news this morning,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; observed. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;It is said
that &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Mr. Turner&lt;/person&gt;, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;An elderly man, I presume?&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business
has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,
and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he
gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed! That is interesting,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about
here speaks of his kindness to him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been
under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son
to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and
that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a
proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we
know that &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Turner&lt;/person&gt; himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us
as much. Do you not deduce something from that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;We have got to the deductions and the inferences,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;,
winking at me. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I find it hard enough to tackle facts, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, without
flying away after theories and fancies.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are right,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; demurely; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;you do find it very hard to
tackle the facts.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to
get hold of,&lt;/quote&gt; replied &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; with some warmth.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And that is—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;That &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; senior met his death from &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; junior and that all
theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the
left.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Yes, that is it.&lt;/quote&gt; It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,
two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon
the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,
gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay
heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’
request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his
death, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had
then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight
different points, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; desired to be led to the court-yard, from
which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as
this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker
Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and
darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his
eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was
bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins
stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed
to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so
absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or
remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a
quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the
woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that
district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and
amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little
detour into the meadow. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; and I walked behind him, the detective
indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the
interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions
was directed towards a definite end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some
fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley
Farm and the private park of the wealthy &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Mr. Turner&lt;/person&gt;. Above the woods
which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting
pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. On
the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was
a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of
the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; showed us the
exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was
the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by
the fall of the stricken man. To &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, as I could see by his eager
face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the
trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and
then turned upon my companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What did you go into the pool for?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or
other trace. But how on earth—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward
twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it
vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I
been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over
it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have
covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are
three separate tracks of the same feet.&lt;/quote&gt; He drew out a lens and lay
down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time
rather to himself than to us. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;These are young &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;’s feet. Twice
he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply
marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran
when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father’s feet
as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the
gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here?
Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go,
they come again—of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they
come from?&lt;/quote&gt; He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the
track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the
shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained
there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what
seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens
not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could
reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he
carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the
wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It has been a case of considerable interest,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, returning
to his natural manner. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I fancy that this grey house on the right must
be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and
perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our
luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into
Ross, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up
in the wood.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This may interest you, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, holding it out. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The
murder was done with it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I see no marks.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There are none.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;How do you know, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.
There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds
with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;And the murderer?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses
a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are
several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our
search.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; laughed. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed
British jury.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;_Nous verrons_,&lt;/quote&gt; answered &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; calmly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You work your own method,
and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall
probably return to London by the evening train.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;And leave your case unfinished?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, finished.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;But the mystery?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is solved.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Who was the criminal, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The gentleman I describe.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;But who is he?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
populous neighbourhood.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; shrugged his shoulders. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I am a practical man,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;and
I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a
left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;All right,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; quietly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have given you the chance. Here
are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having left &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we
found lunch upon the table. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was silent and buried in thought
with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a
perplexing position.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Look here, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said when the cloth was cleared &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;just sit down
in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t know quite
what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me
expound.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Pray do so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young
&lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they
impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that
his father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing
him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled
several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s
ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will
begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as
far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within
earshot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it
was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly
Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a
strong presumption that the person whom &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; expected to meet him
at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What of the rat, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it
out on the table. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,&lt;/quote&gt; he said.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I wired to Bristol for it last night.&lt;/quote&gt; He put his hand over part of
the map. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you read?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;ARAT,&lt;/quote&gt; I read.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now?&lt;/quote&gt; He raised his hand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;BALLARAT.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only
caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his
murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is wonderful!&lt;/quote&gt; I exclaimed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,
granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have
come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an
Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Certainly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be
approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly
wander.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Quite so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I
gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, as
to the personality of the criminal.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But how did you gain them?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his
stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, they were peculiar boots.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But his lameness?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his
left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But his left-handedness.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by
the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately
behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it
were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the
interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found
the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables
me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some
attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140
different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found
the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which
are rolled in Rotterdam.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And the cigar-holder?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used
a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not
a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; I said, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;you have drawn a net round this man from which he
cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if
you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in
which all this points. The culprit is—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;&lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Mr. John Turner&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our
sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,
limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,
and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs
showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of
character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping
eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his
appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the
corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear
to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic
disease.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray sit down on the sofa,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; gently. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You had my note?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see
me here to avoid scandal.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;And why did you wish to see me?&lt;/quote&gt; He looked across at my companion with
despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, answering the look rather than the words. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is
so. I know all about &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old man sank his face in his hands. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;God help me!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;But I
would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that
I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am glad to hear you say so,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; gravely.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would
break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am
arrested.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It may not come to that,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;What?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who
required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young
&lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; must be got off, however.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;I am a dying man,&lt;/quote&gt; said old &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Turner&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;I have had diabetes for years. My
doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would
rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a
bundle of paper before him. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just tell us the truth,&lt;/quote&gt; he said. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I shall
jot down the facts. You will sign it, and &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt; here can witness it.
Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save
young &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is
absolutely needed.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;It’s as well,&lt;/quote&gt; said the old man; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;it’s a question whether I shall live
to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare
&lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Alice&lt;/person&gt; the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has
been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;You didn’t know this dead man, &lt;person perName="Charles_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt;. He was a devil incarnate. I
tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my
life. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;It was in the early ’60’s at the diggings. I was a young chap then,
hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got
among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to
the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway
robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,
sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the
road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,
and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay
in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us,
so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the
first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the
swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this
very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I
spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as
though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became
wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.
There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a
quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be
in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to
make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and
though my wife died young she left me my dear little &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Alice&lt;/person&gt;. Even when
she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path
as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and
did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy
laid his grip upon me.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent
Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as
good as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can
have the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country
is England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them
off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.
There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I
would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse
as &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Alice&lt;/person&gt; grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my
past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever
it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last
he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for &lt;person perName="Alice_Turner"&gt;Alice&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known
to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad
should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not
have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to
the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.
McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at
the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a
cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I
listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come
uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little
regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the
streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear
should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the
bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind
and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my
memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that
foul tongue. I did it, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. I would do it again. Deeply as I
have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that
my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if
he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;
but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back
to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true
story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, it is not for me to judge you,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I pray that we may
never be exposed to such a temptation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will
soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I
will keep your confession, and if &lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; is condemned I shall be
forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and
your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;Farewell, then,&lt;/quote&gt; said the old man solemnly. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Turner"&gt;Your own deathbeds, when
they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you
have given to mine.&lt;/quote&gt; Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he
stumbled slowly from the room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;God help us!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; after a long silence. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why does fate play
such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as
this that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for
the grace of God, goes &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="James_McCarthy"&gt;James McCarthy&lt;/person&gt; was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number
of objections which had been drawn out by &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; and submitted to the
defending counsel. Old &lt;person perName="John_Turner"&gt;Turner&lt;/person&gt; lived for seven months after our
interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son
and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the
black cloud which rests upon their past.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="V"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I glance over my notes and records of the &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; cases
between the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present
strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained
publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for
those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,
and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too,
have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,
beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially
cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture
and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in
its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give
some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in
connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,
entirely cleared up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or
less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under
this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the
Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious
club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts
connected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the
singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and
finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be
remembered, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was able, by winding up the dead man’s
watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction
which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these
I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such
singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have
now taken up my pen to describe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had
set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the
rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of
great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the
instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those
great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his
civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the
storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a
child in the chimney. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was
deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of the
gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the
rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was
on a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once
more in my old quarters at Baker Street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, glancing up at my companion, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that was surely the bell.
Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Except yourself I have none,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I do not encourage
visitors.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;A client, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on
such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to
be some crony of the landlady’s.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a
step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his
long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant
chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Come in!&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,
well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy
in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and
his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he
had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I
could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a
man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I owe you an apology,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his
  eyes. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some
traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Give me your coat and umbrella,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They may rest here on
the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the
south-west, I see.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;Yes, from Horsham.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite
distinctive.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I have come for advice.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is easily got.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;And help.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is not always so easy.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I have heard of you, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. I heard from Major Prendergast how
you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;He said that you could solve anything.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He said too much.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;That you are never beaten.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a
woman.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;But what is that compared with the number of your successes?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is true that I have been generally successful.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;Then you may be so with me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with
some details as to your case.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;It is no ordinary one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have
ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events
than those which have happened in my own family.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You fill me with interest,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray give us the essential
facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to
those details which seem to me to be most important.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards
the blaze.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;My name,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;is &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;John Openshaw&lt;/person&gt;, but my own affairs have, as far
as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a
hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must
go back to the commencement of the affair.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and my
father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he
enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee
of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such
success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome
competence.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became
a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At
the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and afterwards under
Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my
uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four
years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small
estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune
in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the
negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the
franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,
very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if
ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields
round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very
often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great
deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and
did not want any friends, not even his own brother.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;He didn’t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time
when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be
in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He
begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in
his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and
draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the
servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was
sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could
go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him
in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a
single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably
locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to
enter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I
was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and
bundles as would be expected in such a room.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon
the table in front of the colonel’s plate. It was not a common thing
for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,
and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he as he took it
up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out
there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon
his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my
lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were
protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope
which he still held in his trembling hand, ‘K. K. K.!’ he shrieked, and
then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,
leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw
scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter
K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried
pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the
breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with
an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,
and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he
with an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,
and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step
up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there
was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass
box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,
with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had
read in the morning upon the envelope.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave my
estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my
brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you
can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my
advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to
give you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are
going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.
The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression
upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind
without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off
the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation
grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the
usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however.
He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of
society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door
locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of
drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the
garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of
no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush
tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man
who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the
roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold
day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;Well, to come to an end of the matter, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and not to abuse
your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken
sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to
search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay
at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the
water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his
known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew
how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade
myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of
some £ 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One moment,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; interposed, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;your statement is, I foresee, one of
the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date
of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his
supposed suicide.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,
upon the night of May 2nd.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you. Pray proceed.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made
a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We
found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On
the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.
K. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’
written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers
which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered
papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some of
them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and
had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during
the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned
with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the
carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at
Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of
’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a
sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There
he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried
orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always
laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but
he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the
very letters. But what is this written above them?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the
papers must be those that are destroyed.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilised
land here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the
thing come from?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the postmark.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with
sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘Then let me do so?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I
went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from
home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command
of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,
for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away
from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his
absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at
once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound
in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.
I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his
consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in
the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit
unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘death
from accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected
with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the
idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And
yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I
was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I
did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our
troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s
life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in
another.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years
and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived
happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed
away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I
had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow
fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning
to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;This is the envelope,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;The postmark is London—eastern
division. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last
message: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What have you done?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;Nothing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nothing?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;To tell the truth&lt;/quote&gt;—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I have
felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the
snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some
resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can
guard against.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Tut! tut!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You must act, man, or you are lost.
Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I have seen the police.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the
inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical
jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as
the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; shook his clenched hands in the air. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Incredible imbecility!&lt;/quote&gt; he
cried.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
house with me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Has he come with you to-night?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;No. His orders were to stay in the house.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; raved in the air.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why did you come to me?&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;and, above all, why did you not
come at once?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast
about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted
before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which
you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;There is one thing,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;John Openshaw&lt;/person&gt;. He rummaged in his coat
pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he
laid it out upon the table. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I have some remembrance,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;that
on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,
unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular
colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am
inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,
fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped
destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us
much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The
writing is undoubtedly my uncle’s.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which
showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It
was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following enigmatical
notices:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.
Augustine."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"9th. McCauley cleared."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"10th. John Swain cleared."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, folding up the paper and returning it to our
visitor. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now you must on no account lose another instant. We
cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get
home instantly and act.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;What shall I do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put
this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which
you have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the
other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one
which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry
conviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box
out upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;Entirely.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think
that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to
weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to
remove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear
up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I thank you,&lt;/quote&gt; said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
  &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you
advise.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the
meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are
threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;By train from Waterloo.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you
may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I am armed.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;I shall see you at Horsham, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Openshaw"&gt;Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to
the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.&lt;/quote&gt;
He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still
screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This
strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad
elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to
have been reabsorbed by them once more.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit
his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings
as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked at last, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that of all our cases we have
had none more fantastic than this.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;John Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; seems to me
to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But have you,&lt;/quote&gt; I asked, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;formed any definite conception as to what
these perils are?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There can be no question as to their nature,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this
unhappy family?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of
his chair, with his finger-tips together. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The ideal reasoner,&lt;/quote&gt; he
remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its
bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up
to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As Cuvier
could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a
single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in
a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other
ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which
the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of
their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is
necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts
which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you
will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these
days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare
accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should
possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,
and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly,
you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my
limits in a very precise fashion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered, laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It was a singular document. Philosophy,
astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany
variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region
within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,
sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,
swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I
think, were the main points of my analysis.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; grinned at the last item. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I say now, as I said
then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all
the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in
the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.
Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us
to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me
down the letter K of the _American Encyclopædia_ which stands upon the
shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see
what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a
strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason
for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the
lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of solitude
in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or
something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of
someone or something which drove him from America. As to what it was he
feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters
which were received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the
postmarks of those letters?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third
from London.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;From East London. What do you deduce from that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the
probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a
ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of
Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,
in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest
anything?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;A greater distance to travel.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But the letter had also a greater distance to come.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then I do not see the point.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or
men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their
singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.
You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from
Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have
arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven
weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the
difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the
sailing vessel which brought the writer.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is possible.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of
this new case, and why I urged young &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; to caution. The blow has
always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to
travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we
cannot count upon delay.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Good God!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What can it mean, this relentless persecution?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The papers which &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; carried are obviously of vital importance to
the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite
clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not
have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s
jury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men
of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the
holder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be
the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But of what society?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you never—&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, bending forward and sinking his
voice—&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I never have.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Here it is,&lt;/quote&gt;
said he presently:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the
sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was
formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the
Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of
the country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,
and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for
the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from
the country of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were
usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,
melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this the victim
might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the
country. If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon
him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was
the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that
there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving
it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to
the perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869,
the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been
sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You will observe,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laying down the volume, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that the
sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance
of &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; from America with their papers. It may well have been cause
and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the
more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this
register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,
and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is
recovered.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then the page we have seen—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the
pips to A, B, and C’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them. Then
there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,
and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.
Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,
and I believe that the only chance young &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; has in the meantime
is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to
be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget
for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
ways of our fellow men.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued
brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was already at breakfast when I came down.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You will excuse me for not waiting for you,&lt;/quote&gt; said he; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have, I
foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young
&lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt;’s.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What steps will you take?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may
have to go down to Horsham, after all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You will not go there first?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid
will bring up your coffee.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced
my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my
heart.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;you are too late.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah!&lt;/quote&gt; said he, laying down his cup, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I feared as much. How was it
done?&lt;/quote&gt; He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My eye caught the name of &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt;, and the heading ‘Tragedy Near
Waterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account:
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;‘Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a
splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,
so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite
impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was given, and, by
the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It
proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from
an envelope which was found in his pocket, was &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;John Openshaw&lt;/person&gt;, and whose
residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been
hurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that
in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked
over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.
The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt
that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which
should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to
the condition of the riverside landing-stages.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat in silence for some minutes, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; more depressed and shaken
than I had ever seen him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That hurts my pride, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he said at last. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a petty feeling,
no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me
now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang.
That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to
his death—!&lt;/quote&gt; He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in
uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a
nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They must be cunning devils,&lt;/quote&gt; he exclaimed at last. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How could they
have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line
to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a
night, for their purpose. Well, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, we shall see who will win in
the long run. I am going out now!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;To the police?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take
the flies, but not before.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the
evening before I returned to Baker Street. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had not come
back yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and
worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf
he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of
water.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You are hungry,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
breakfast.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Nothing?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And how have you succeeded?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You have a clue?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; shall not long
remain unavenged. Why, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, let us put their own devilish trade-mark
upon them. It is well thought of!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What do you mean?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and thrust
them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote "S. H. for J.
O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun,
Barque _Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That will await him when he enters port,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, chuckling. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It may
give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his
fate as &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; did before him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And who is this Captain Calhoun?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How did you trace it, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates
and names.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have spent the whole day,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;over Lloyd’s registers and
files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel
which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There were
thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those
months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my
attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from
London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the
Union.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Texas, I think.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an
American origin.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque _Lone
Star_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I
then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of
London.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert
Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide
this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and
learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly
I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins and not very far from
the Isle of Wight.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What will you do, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the
only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and
Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last
night. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By
the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will
have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police
of Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a
charge of murder.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the
murderers of &lt;person perName="John_Openshaw"&gt;John Openshaw&lt;/person&gt; were never to receive the orange pips which
would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,
was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial
gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone Star_ of
Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere
far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen
swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon
it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _Lone
Star_.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="VI"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Isa Whitney&lt;/person&gt;, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the
Theological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The
habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he
was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams
and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that
the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years
he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and
pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,
pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a
chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the
hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up
in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made
a little face of disappointment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;A patient!&lt;/quote&gt; said she. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;You’ll have to go out.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon
the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some
dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Kate_Whitney"&gt;You will excuse my calling so late,&lt;/quote&gt; she began, and then, suddenly
losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my
wife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. &lt;quote spokeBy="Kate_Whitney"&gt;Oh, I’m in such trouble!&lt;/quote&gt;
  she cried; &lt;quote spokeBy="Kate_Whitney"&gt;I do so want a little help.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;Why,&lt;/quote&gt; said my wife, pulling up her veil, &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;it is &lt;person perName="Kate_Whitney"&gt;Kate Whitney&lt;/person&gt;. How you
startled me, &lt;person perName="Kate_Whitney"&gt;Kate&lt;/person&gt;! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Kate_Whitney"&gt;I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.&lt;/quote&gt; That was always
the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a
lighthouse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Watson"&gt;It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and
water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you
rather that I sent &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;James&lt;/person&gt; off to bed?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Kate_Whitney"&gt;Oh, no, no! I want the doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa.
He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s
trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school
companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.
Did she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring
him back to her?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he
had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest
east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one
day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But
now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay
there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison
or sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of
it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do?
How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place
and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.
Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,
why should she come at all? I was &lt;person perName="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Isa Whitney&lt;/person&gt;’s medical adviser, and as
such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were
alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab
within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given
me. And so in ten minutes I had left my armchair and cheery
sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a
strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only
could show how strange it was to be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.
Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of
steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the
den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down
the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken
feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found
the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with
the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in
strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown
back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,
lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black shadows
there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as
the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The
most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked
together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming
in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling
out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his
neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,
beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his
knees, staring into the fire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for
me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Thank you. I have not come to stay,&lt;/quote&gt; said I. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;There is a friend of
mine here, &lt;person perName="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Mr. Isa Whitney&lt;/person&gt;, and I wish to speak with him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering
through the gloom, I saw &lt;person perName="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Whitney&lt;/person&gt;, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring
out at me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Isa_Whitney"&gt;My God! It’s &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,
with every nerve in a twitter. &lt;quote spokeBy="Isa_Whitney"&gt;I say, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, what o’clock is it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Nearly eleven.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Of what day?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Of Friday, June 19th.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you
want to frighten a chap for?&lt;/quote&gt; He sank his face onto his arms and began
to sob in a high treble key.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two
days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Isa_Whitney"&gt;So I am. But you’ve got mixed, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, for I have only been here a few
hours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home with
you. I wouldn’t frighten &lt;person perName="Kate_Whitney"&gt;Kate&lt;/person&gt;—poor little &lt;person perName="Kate_Whitney"&gt;Kate&lt;/person&gt;. Give me your hand! Have
you a cab?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes, I have one waiting.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,
&lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,
holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,
and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by
the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice
whispered, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Walk past me, and then look back at me.&lt;/quote&gt; The words fell
quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come
from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,
very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down
from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude
from his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all
my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.
His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my
surprise, was none other than &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. He made a slight motion
to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round
to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped
senility.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt; I whispered, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;what on earth are you doing in this den?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;As low as you can,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have excellent ears. If you would
have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I
should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have a cab outside.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you
also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have
thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with
you in five minutes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to refuse any of &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ requests, for they
were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet
air of mastery. I felt, however, that when &lt;person perName="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Whitney&lt;/person&gt; was once confined in
the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I
could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in
one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his
existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid &lt;person perName="Isa_Whitney"&gt;Whitney&lt;/person&gt;’s bill,
led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I
was walking down the street with &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. For two streets he
shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then, glancing
quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit
of laughter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I suppose, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that you imagine that I have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I was certainly surprised to find you there.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But not more so than I to find you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I came to find a friend.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And I to find an enemy.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;An enemy?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.
Briefly, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I
have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as
I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would
not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it before now
for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to
have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What! You do not mean bodies?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ay, bodies, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. We should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every
poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest
murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;
has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.&lt;/quote&gt; He
put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal
which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed
shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’ hoofs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the
gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side
lanterns. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You’ll come with me, won’t you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;If I can be of use.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.
My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The Cedars?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes; that is &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;’s house. I am staying there while I conduct
the inquiry.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Where is it, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But I am all in the dark.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.
All right, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;John&lt;/person&gt;; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out
for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the
endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened
gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with
the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull
wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,
regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some
belated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the
sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts
of the clouds. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside
him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax
his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of
his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to
the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,
shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who
has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have a grand gift of silence, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It makes you
quite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing for
me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not
over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little
woman to-night when she meets me at the door.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You forget that I know nothing about it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get
to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to
go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end of
it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,
&lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Proceed, then.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a
gentleman, &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; by name, who appeared to have plenty of
money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and
lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the
neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,
by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was
interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the
morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. St.
Clair&lt;/person&gt; is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a
good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with
all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,
as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £ 88 10_s_., while
he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.
There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been
weighing upon his mind.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Last Monday &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; went into town rather earlier than
usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a
box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram
upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect
that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting
was waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.
Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office
of the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam
Lane, where you found me to-night. &lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; had her lunch,
started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s
office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking
through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed
me so far?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is very clear.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and &lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;
walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did
not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was
walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an
ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down
at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor
window. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she
describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to
her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to
her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from
behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he
had on neither collar nor necktie.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you
found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to
ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the
stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,
who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,
pushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts
and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in
Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their
way to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and
in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their
way to the room in which &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; had last been seen. There was no
sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one
to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,
made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one
else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined was
their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to
believe that &lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; had been deluded when, with a cry, she
sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid
from it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy
which he had promised to bring home.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,
made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. The rooms were
carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The
front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small
bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. Between
the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low
tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of
water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and
several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the
bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the
clothes of &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;, with the exception of his coat. His
boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there. There were no
signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other
traces of &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;. Out of the window he must apparently
have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous
bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save
himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment
of the tragedy.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in
the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,
but as, by &lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;’s story, he was known to have been at the
foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance
at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the
crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that
he had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and
that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentleman’s clothes.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives
upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last
human being whose eyes rested upon &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;. His name is Hugh
Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who
goes much to the City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to
avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax
vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the
left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in
the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a
piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy
leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the
fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional
acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has
reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that
no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a
pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair
of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the
colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of
mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply
to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.
This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium
den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are
in quest.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But a cripple!&lt;/quote&gt; said I. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What could he have done single-handed against
a man in the prime of life?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other
respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your
medical experience would tell you, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that weakness in one limb is
often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Pray continue your narrative.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,
and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could
be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who
had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the
premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the
matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as
he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated
with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he
was seized and searched, without anything being found which could
incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his
right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,
adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the
stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same
source. He denied strenuously having ever seen &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;
and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a
mystery to him as to the police. As to &lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;’s assertion that
she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she
must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly
protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon
the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh
clue.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had
feared to find. It was &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;’s coat, and not &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville St.
Clair&lt;/person&gt;, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think
they found in the pockets?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot imagine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies
and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder
that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a
different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the
house. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when
the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.
Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that
this man Boone had thrust &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; through the window, there
is no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?
It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the
tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of
throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not
sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when
the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard
from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard,
where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all
the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure
of the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same
with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and
only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It certainly sounds feasible.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but
it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against
him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life
appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter
stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what
&lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt; was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when
there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his
disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I
cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had been detailing this singular series of
events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town
until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled
along with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,
however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights
still glimmered in the windows.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We are on the outskirts of Lee,&lt;/quote&gt; said my companion. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We have touched
on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,
passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light
among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman
whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink
of our horse’s feet.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs. St.
Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest
assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and
colleague. I hate to meet her, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, when I have no news of her
husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own
grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and springing
down, I followed &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to
the house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde
woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de
soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She
stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand
upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly
bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a
standing question.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Well?&lt;/quote&gt; she cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;well?&lt;/quote&gt; And then, seeing that there were two of us,
she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my
companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;No good news?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;None.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;No bad?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a
long day.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is my friend, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt;. He has been of most vital use to me in
several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to
bring him out and associate him with this investigation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;I am delighted to see you,&lt;/quote&gt; said she, pressing my hand warmly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;You
will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly
upon us.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My dear madam,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I
can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any
assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed
happy.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Now, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said the lady as we entered a well-lit
dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,
  &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to
which I beg that you will give a plain answer.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Certainly, madam.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to
fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Upon what point?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; seemed to be embarrassed by the question. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Frankly,
now!&lt;/quote&gt; she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at
him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Frankly, then, madam, I do not.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;You think that he is dead?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I do.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Murdered?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I don’t say that. Perhaps.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;And on what day did he meet his death?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On Monday.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Then perhaps, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, you will be good enough to explain how it is
that I have received a letter from him to-day.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What!&lt;/quote&gt; he roared.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Yes, to-day.&lt;/quote&gt; She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in
the air.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;May I see it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Certainly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the
table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I had left my
chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very
coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the
date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was
considerably after midnight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Coarse writing,&lt;/quote&gt; murmured &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Surely this is not your husband’s
writing, madam.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;No, but the enclosure is.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and
inquire as to the address.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;How can you tell that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.
The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has
been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none
would be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and
there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only
mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but
there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.
Ha! there has been an enclosure here!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;One of his hands.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,
and yet I know it well.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge
error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in
patience.—&lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;NEVILLE&lt;/person&gt;.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,
octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man
with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very
much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have
no doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;None. &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Neville&lt;/person&gt; wrote those words.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, &lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;, the
clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is
over.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;But he must be alive, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The
ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
posted to-day.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;That is possible.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If so, much may have happened between.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Oh, you must not discourage me, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. I know that all is well
with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if
evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself
in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly
with the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think
that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his
death?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be
more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And in
this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to
corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write
letters, why should he remain away from you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Very much so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was the window open?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then he might have called to you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;He might.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;A call for help, you thought?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Yes. He waved his hands.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;It is possible.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And you thought he was pulled back?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;He disappeared so suddenly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the
Lascar was at the foot of the stairs.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary
clothes on?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Never.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Never.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you, &lt;person perName="Mrs_St_Clair"&gt;Mrs. St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;. Those are the principal points about which
I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and
then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after
my night of adventure. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was a man, however, who, when he
had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for
a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking
at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or
convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident
to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off
his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then
wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions
from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an
ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. In
the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe
between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the
ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with
the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I
dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The
pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the
room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap
of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Awake, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Game for a morning drive?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Certainly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy
sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.&lt;/quote&gt; He chuckled to himself as
he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the
sombre thinker of the previous night.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was
stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished
when &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; returned with the news that the boy was putting in the
horse.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I want to test a little theory of mine,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, pulling on his
boots. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that you are now standing in the presence of
one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from
here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And where is it?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked, smiling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In the bathroom,&lt;/quote&gt; he answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, yes, I am not joking,&lt;/quote&gt; he
continued, seeing my look of incredulity. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have just been there, and
I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,
my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the
bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with the
half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away
we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,
bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on
either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It has been in some points a singular case,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, flicking the
horse on into a gallop. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I confess that I have been as blind as a mole,
but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from
their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.
Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and
dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found
ourselves in Bow Street. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was well known to the force,
and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the
horse’s head while the other led us in.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Who is on duty?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Inspector &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt;, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt;, how are you?&lt;/quote&gt; A tall, stout official had come down the
stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I wish to
have a quiet word with you, &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Certainly, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. Step into my room here.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,
and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
desk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;What can I do for you, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with
being concerned in the disappearance of &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;, of Lee.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So I heard. You have him here?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;In the cells.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Is he quiet?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Dirty?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is
as black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he
will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would
agree with me that he needed it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I should like to see him very much.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your
bag.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, I think that I’ll take it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Very good. Come this way, if you please.&lt;/quote&gt; He led us down a passage,
opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a
whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;The third on the right is his,&lt;/quote&gt; said the inspector. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Here it is!&lt;/quote&gt; He
quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced
through.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;He is asleep,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;You can see him very well.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face
towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was
a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a
coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He
was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which
covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad
wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its
contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three
teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red
hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;He’s a beauty, isn’t he?&lt;/quote&gt; said the inspector.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He certainly needs a wash,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I had an idea that he
might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.&lt;/quote&gt; He opened
the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very
large bath-sponge.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;He! he! You are a funny one,&lt;/quote&gt; chuckled the inspector.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Well, I don’t know why not,&lt;/quote&gt; said the inspector. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;He doesn’t look a
credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?&lt;/quote&gt; He slipped his key into the
lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half
turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it
twice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Let me introduce you,&lt;/quote&gt; he shouted, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;to &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;, of Lee,
in the county of Kent.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off
under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown
tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and
the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A
twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his
bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and
smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy
bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a
scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Great heavens!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the inspector, &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;it is, indeed, the missing man.
I know him from the photograph.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself
to his destiny. &lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Be it so,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;And pray what am I charged with?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;With making away with Mr. Neville St.— Oh, come, you can’t be charged
with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,&lt;/quote&gt; said the
inspector with a grin. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Well, I have been twenty-seven years in the
force, but this really takes the cake.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;If I am &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;, then it is obvious that no crime has
been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No crime, but a very great error has been committed,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You would have done better to have trusted your wife.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;It was not the wife; it was the children,&lt;/quote&gt; groaned the prisoner. &lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;God
help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an
exposure! What can I do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly
on the shoulder.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,&lt;/quote&gt; said he,
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you
convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against
you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should
find their way into the papers. Inspector &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt; would, I am sure,
make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the
proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;God bless you!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the prisoner passionately. &lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;I would have endured
imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable
secret as a family blot to my children.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.
I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a
reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to
have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I
volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my
adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I
could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I
had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been
famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of my
attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as
possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by
the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head
of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.
For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the
evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.
4_d_.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some
time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me
for £ 25. I was at my wit’s end where to get the money, but a sudden
idea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked
for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the
City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid the
debt.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work
at £ 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by
smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and
sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but
the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day
in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly
face and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret.
He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam
Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the
evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This
fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew
that my secret was safe in his possession.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.
I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £ 700
a year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional
advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of
repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised
character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,
poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take
£ 2.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,
and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real
occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She
little knew what.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room
above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my
horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with
her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms
to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated
him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice
downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off
my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and
wig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But
then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and
that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by
my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the
bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the
coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in
which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it
disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but
at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few
minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of
being identified as &lt;person perName="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Mr. Neville St. Clair&lt;/person&gt;, I was arrested as his
murderer.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was
determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my
preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly
anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a
moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried
scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That note only reached her yesterday,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Good God! What a week she must have spent!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;The police have watched this Lascar,&lt;/quote&gt; said Inspector &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;and
I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter
unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who
forgot all about it for some days.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That was it,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, nodding approvingly; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have no doubt of
it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;Many times; but what was a fine to me?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;It must stop here, however,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;If the police are to
hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Neville_St_Clair"&gt;I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be
taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared
the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I reached this one,&lt;/quote&gt; said my friend, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;by sitting upon five pillows and
consuming an ounce of shag. I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that if we drive to Baker
Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="VII"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had called upon my friend &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; upon the second morning
after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of
the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a
pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled
morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch
was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and
disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in
several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
purpose of examination.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You are engaged,&lt;/quote&gt; said I; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;perhaps I interrupt you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my
results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one&lt;/quote&gt;—he jerked his thumb in
the direction of the old hat—&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;but there are points in connection with
it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were
thick with the ice crystals. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I suppose,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that, homely as
it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is
the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the
punishment of some crime.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, no. No crime,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Only one of those
whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million
human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square
miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,
every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and
many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and
bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of
such.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;So much so,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;that of the last six cases which I have
added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the &lt;person perName="Irene_Adler"&gt;Irene Adler&lt;/person&gt; papers,
to the singular case of &lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Mary Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;, and to the adventure of
the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small
matter will fall into the same innocent category. You know &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt;,
the &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;commissionaire&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is to him that this trophy belongs.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is his hat.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look
upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.
And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,
in company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting
at this moment in front of &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt;’s fire. The facts are these: about
four o’clock on Christmas morning, &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt;, who, as you know, is a
very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was
making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he
saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a
little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on
which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his
head, smashed the shop window behind him. &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt; had rushed forward
to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at
having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in
uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and
vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of
Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and
also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a
most unimpeachable Christmas goose.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Which surely he restored to their owner?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.
&lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s
left leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible
upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,
and some hundreds of &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;s in this city of ours, it is not easy
to restore lost property to any one of them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What, then, did &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt; do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The
goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in
spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten
without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to
fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the
hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Did he not advertise?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Only as much as we can deduce.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;From his hat?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as
to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,
hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but
was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker’s name; but, as &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
had remarked, the initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was
pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For
the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several
places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I can see nothing,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, handing it back to my friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On the contrary, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, you can see everything. You fail, however, to
reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your
inferences.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
which was characteristic of him. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is perhaps less suggestive than it
might have been,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;and yet there are a few inferences
which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a
strong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual is
of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly
well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon
evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing
to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at
work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife
has ceased to love him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My dear &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued,
disregarding my remonstrance. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He is a man who leads a sedentary life,
goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has
grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which
he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are
to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is extremely
improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You are certainly joking, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these
results, you are unable to see how they are attained?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am
unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was
intellectual?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For answer &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the
forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a question of
cubic capacity,&lt;/quote&gt; said he; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;a man with so large a brain must have
something in it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The decline of his fortunes, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came
in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of
ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy
so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he
has assuredly gone down in the world.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and
the moral retrogression?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; laughed. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Here is the foresight,&lt;/quote&gt; said he putting his
finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They are
never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a
certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this
precaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the
elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has
less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a
weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some
of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign
that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,
that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to
be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.
The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the
scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a
distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the
gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the
marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer
perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of
training.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
&lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your
wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also
have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But he might be a bachelor.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.
Remember the card upon the bird’s leg.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that
the gas is not laid on in his house?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no
less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the
individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning
tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a
guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from
a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Well, it is very ingenious,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, laughing; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;but since, as you said
just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the
loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,
and &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt;, the &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;commissionaire&lt;/person&gt;, rushed into the apartment with
flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Peterson"&gt;The goose, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;! The goose, sir!&lt;/quote&gt; he gasped.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through
the kitchen window?&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; twisted himself round upon the sofa to get
a fairer view of the man’s excited face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Peterson"&gt;See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!&lt;/quote&gt; He held out his
hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of
such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the
dark hollow of his hand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat up with a whistle. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;By Jove, &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt; said he,
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Peterson"&gt;A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were
putty.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!&lt;/quote&gt; I ejaculated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have
read the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It is
absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the
reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of
the market price.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Peterson"&gt;A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!&lt;/quote&gt; The &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;commissionaire&lt;/person&gt; plumped
down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the
Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the
gem.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,&lt;/quote&gt; I
remarked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a
plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s
jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has
been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I
believe.&lt;/quote&gt; He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,
until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the
following paragraph:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted
from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as
the blue carbuncle. &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;James Ryder&lt;/person&gt;, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his
evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room
of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he
might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called
away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the
bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in
which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep
her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;Ryder&lt;/person&gt; instantly
gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone
could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine
&lt;person perName="Catherine Cusack"&gt;Cusack&lt;/person&gt;, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;Ryder&lt;/person&gt;’s cry of
dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector
Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who
struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest
terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given
against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the
offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of
intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion
and was carried out of court.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hum! So much for the police-court,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; thoughtfully, tossing
aside the paper. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The question for us now to solve is the sequence of
events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a
goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, our little
deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less
innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and
the goose came from &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;, the gentleman with the bad hat and
all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we
must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do
this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly
in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall
have recourse to other methods.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What will you say?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the
corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;
can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker
Street.’ That is clear and concise.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Very. But will he see it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,
the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in
breaking the window and by the approach of &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt; that he thought of
nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the
impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, the
introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who
knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt;, run
down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening
papers.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Peterson"&gt;In which, sir?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James’s Gazette_,
_Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Peterson"&gt;Very well, sir. And this stone?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;Peterson&lt;/person&gt;, just
buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must
have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your
family is now devouring.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;person perName="Peterson"&gt;commissionaire&lt;/person&gt; had gone, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; took up the stone and held it
against the light. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s a bonny thing,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just see how it
glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.
Every good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and
older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not
yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in
southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the
carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite
of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two
murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought
about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows
and the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to
the Countess to say that we have it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I cannot tell.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;, had
anything to do with the matter?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is, I think, much more likely that &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt; is an absolutely
innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was
of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,
however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer
to our advertisement.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And you can do nothing until then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Nothing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come
back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like
to see the solution of so tangled a business.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.
By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask &lt;person perName="Mrs_Hudson"&gt;Mrs.
Hudson&lt;/person&gt; to examine its crop.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six
when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached the
house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was
buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which
was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was opened,
and we were shown up together to &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;, I believe,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, rising from his armchair and
greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so
readily assume. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray take this chair by the fire, &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Baker&lt;/person&gt;. It is a
cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for
summer than for winter. Ah, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, you have just come at the right
time. Is that your hat, &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Baker&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,
intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. A
touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended
hand, recalled &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ surmise as to his habits. His rusty black
frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,
and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff
or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with
care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and
letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We have retained these things for some days,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;because we
expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at
a loss to know now why you did not advertise.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. &lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;Shillings have not been so
  plentiful with me as they once were,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;I had no doubt that
the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the
bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at
recovering them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat
it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;To eat it!&lt;/quote&gt; Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I
presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the
same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally
well?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;Oh, certainly, certainly,&lt;/quote&gt; answered &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Baker&lt;/person&gt; with a sigh of relief.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your
own bird, so if you wish—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man burst into a hearty laugh. &lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;They might be useful to me as
  relics of my adventure,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;but beyond that I can hardly see
what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be
to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my
attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his
shoulders.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is your hat, then, and there your bird,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;By the way,
would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am
somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown
goose.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;Certainly, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained
  property under his arm. &lt;quote spokeBy="Henry_Baker"&gt;There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha
Inn, near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during the
day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,
instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence
every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were
duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,
sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.&lt;/quote&gt;
With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
strode off upon his way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So much for &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; when he had closed the door
behind him. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about
the matter. Are you hungry, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Not particularly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up
this clue while it is still hot.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;By all means.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats
about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a
cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as
we swung through the doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,
and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter of an
hour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small
public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into
Holborn. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two
glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,&lt;/quote&gt; said
he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;My geese!&lt;/quote&gt; The man seemed surprised.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt;, who was
a member of your goose club.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed! Whose, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Breckinridge is his name.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health landlord, and
prosperity to your house. Good-night.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now for &lt;person perName="Breckinridge"&gt;Mr. Breckinridge&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he continued, buttoning up his coat as we
came out into the frosty air. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Remember, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt; that though we have so
homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the
other a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless
we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but
confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation
which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has
placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to
the south, then, and quick march!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag
of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the
name of &lt;person perName="Breckinridge"&gt;Breckinridge&lt;/person&gt; upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,
with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up
the shutters.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Good-evening. It’s a cold night,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sold out of geese, I see,&lt;/quote&gt; continued &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, pointing at the bare
slabs of marble.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That’s no good.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, but I was recommended to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Who by?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The landlord of the Alpha.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
salesman.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Now, then, mister,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,
  &lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese
which you supplied to the Alpha.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Well then, I shan’t tell you. So now!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should
be so warm over such a trifle.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I
pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the
business; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the
geese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they
were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over
them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making
inquiries,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; carelessly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If you won’t tell us the bet is
off, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter
of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country
bred.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,&lt;/quote&gt; snapped the
salesman.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s nothing of the kind.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;I say it is.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I don’t believe it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them
ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the
Alpha were town bred.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You’ll never persuade me to believe that.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Will you bet, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll
have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salesman chuckled grimly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Bring me the books, Bill,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Now then, Mr. Cocksure,&lt;/quote&gt; said the salesman, &lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;I thought that I was out
of geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left
in my shop. You see this little book?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then,
here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their
names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then! You
see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town
suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Mrs_Oakshott"&gt;Mrs. Oakshott&lt;/person&gt;, 117, Brixton Road—249,&lt;/quote&gt; read &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; turned to the page indicated. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Here you are, ‘&lt;person perName="Mrs_Oakshott"&gt;Mrs. Oakshott&lt;/person&gt;,
117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Now, then, what’s the last entry?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7_s_. 6_d_.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Quite so. There you are. And underneath?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12_s_.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;What have you to say now?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his
pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a
man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped
under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which
was peculiar to him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘Pink ’un’
protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,&lt;/quote&gt; said
he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I daresay that if I had put £ 100 down in front of him, that man
would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him
by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, we are, I
fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains
to be determined is whether we should go on to this &lt;person perName="Mrs_Oakshott"&gt;Mrs. Oakshott&lt;/person&gt;
to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear
from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides
ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out
from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little
rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while &lt;person perName="Breckinridge"&gt;Breckinridge&lt;/person&gt;, the
salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists
fiercely at the cringing figure.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;I’ve had enough of you and your geese,&lt;/quote&gt; he shouted. &lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;I wish you were
all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your
silly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring &lt;person perName="Mrs_Oakshott"&gt;Mrs. Oakshott&lt;/person&gt; here and
I’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese
off you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;No; but one of them was mine all the same,&lt;/quote&gt; whined the little man.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Well, then, ask &lt;person perName="Mrs_Oakshott"&gt;Mrs. Oakshott&lt;/person&gt; for it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;She told me to ask you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Breckinridge"&gt;Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough
of it. Get out of this!&lt;/quote&gt; He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer
flitted away into the darkness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,&lt;/quote&gt; whispered &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Come
with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.&lt;/quote&gt; Striding
through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring
stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him
upon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light
that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Who are you, then? What do you want?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked in a quavering voice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You will excuse me,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; blandly, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;but I could not help
overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I
think that I could be of assistance to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My name is &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. It is my business to know what other
people don’t know.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;But you can know nothing of this?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some
geese which were sold by &lt;person perName="Mrs_Oakshott"&gt;Mrs. Oakshott&lt;/person&gt;, of Brixton Road, to a salesman
named &lt;person perName="Breckinridge"&gt;Breckinridge&lt;/person&gt;, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and
by him to his club, of which &lt;person perName="Henry_Baker"&gt;Mr. Henry Baker&lt;/person&gt; is a member.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the
  little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;I can
hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In that case
we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept
market-place,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it
is that I have the pleasure of assisting.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man hesitated for an instant. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;My name is &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;John Robinson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; he
answered with a sidelong glance.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, no; the real name,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sweetly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is always awkward
doing business with an alias.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Well then,&lt;/quote&gt; said
he, &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;my real name is &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;James Ryder&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into
the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you
would wish to know.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he
is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into
the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker
Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin
breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of
his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Here we are!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; cheerily as we filed into the room. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The
fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;Mr. Ryder&lt;/person&gt;.
Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we
settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what
became of those geese?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which
you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder quivered with emotion. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Oh, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;can you tell me
where it went to?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It came here.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Here?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you
should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the
bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here
in my museum.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his
right hand. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue
carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,
many-pointed radiance. &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;Ryder&lt;/person&gt; stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain
whether to claim or to disown it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The game’s up, &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;Ryder&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; quietly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hold up, man, or you’ll
be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. He’s not
got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of
brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to
be sure!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought
a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened
eyes at his accuser.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could
possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that
little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had
heard, &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;Ryder&lt;/person&gt;, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;It was &lt;person perName="Catherine Cusack"&gt;Catherine Cusack&lt;/person&gt; who told me of it,&lt;/quote&gt; said he in a crackling
voice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden
wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for
better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means
you used. It seems to me, &lt;person perName="James_Ryder"&gt;Ryder&lt;/person&gt;, that there is the making of a very
pretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had
been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would
rest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some
small job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate &lt;person perName="Catherine Cusack"&gt;Cusack&lt;/person&gt;—and you
managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you
rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
arrested. You then—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
companion’s knees. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;For God’s sake, have mercy!&lt;/quote&gt; he shrieked. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Think of
my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went
wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible.
Oh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Get back into your chair!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sternly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is very well to
cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner
in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;I will fly, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge
against him will break down.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of
the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose
into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope
of safety.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;I will tell you it just
  as it happened, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;When Horner had been arrested, it
seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at
once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it
into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about the
hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and
I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and
lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the
way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a
detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring
down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what
was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been
upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard
and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just
been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell
into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what
they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two
things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where
he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn
the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the
agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any
moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my
waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and
looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and
suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
best detective that ever lived.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of
her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as
good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my
stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this
I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. I
caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat
as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the
stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature
flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered
off among the others.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was
feeling which was the fattest.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call it.
It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them, which
makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d
rather have that one I was handling just now.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened
it expressly for you.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you
want, then?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
flock.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Well, I did what she said, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and I carried the bird all the
way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it
was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and
we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for
there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake
had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried
into the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Which dealer’s?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the
one I chose?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell
them apart.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet
would carry me to this man &lt;person perName="Breckinridge"&gt;Breckinridge&lt;/person&gt;; but he had sold the lot at
once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You
heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like
that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am
myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever
having touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!
God help me!&lt;/quote&gt; He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in
his hands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the
measured tapping of &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ finger-tips upon the edge of the
table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Get out!&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="James_Ryder"&gt;What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No more words. Get out!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the
stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls
from the street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;After all, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, reaching up his hand for his clay
pipe, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If
Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will
not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am
commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.
This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides,
it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most
singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If
you will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
feature.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="VIII"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have
during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,
but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his
art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself
with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even
the fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any
which presented more singular features than that which was associated
with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The
events in question occurred in the early days of my association with
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is
possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a
promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been
freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom
the pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now
come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread
rumours as to the death of &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby Roylott&lt;/person&gt; which tend to make the
matter even more terrible than the truth.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was
a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me
that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some
surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself
regular in my habits.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very sorry to knock you up, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;but it’s the common lot
this morning. &lt;person perName="Mrs_Hudson"&gt;Mrs. Hudson&lt;/person&gt; has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,
and I on you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What is it, then—a fire?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable
state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in
the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at
this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,
I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to
communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am
sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I
should call you and give you the chance.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no keener pleasure than in following &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; in his professional
investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as
intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he
unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on
my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down
to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who
had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Good-morning, madam,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; cheerily. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My name is &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. This is my intimate friend and associate, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt;, before
whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see
that &lt;person perName="Mrs_Hudson"&gt;Mrs. Hudson&lt;/person&gt; has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up
to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that
you are shivering.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;It is not cold which makes me shiver,&lt;/quote&gt; said the woman in a low voice,
changing her seat as requested.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;It is fear, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. It is terror.&lt;/quote&gt; She raised her veil as she
spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of
agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,
like those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of
a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her
expression was weary and haggard. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; ran her over with one
of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You must not fear,&lt;/quote&gt; said he soothingly, bending forward and patting
her forearm. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You
have come in by train this morning, I see.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;You know me, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of
your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good
drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the
station.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
companion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is no mystery, my dear madam,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, smiling. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The left arm
of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The
marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which
throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand
side of the driver.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,&lt;/quote&gt; said she. &lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I
started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and
came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no
longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,
save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little
aid. I have heard of you, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;; I have heard of you from Mrs.
Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from
her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could
help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense
darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,
with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find
me ungrateful.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
case-book, which he consulted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Farintosh,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with
an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;. I can only say,
madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I
did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own
reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put
to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay
before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
matter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Alas!&lt;/quote&gt; replied our visitor, &lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;the very horror of my situation lies in
the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so
entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that
even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and
advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a
nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing
answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, that you can
see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may
advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am all attention, madam.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;My name is &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Helen Stoner&lt;/person&gt;, and I am living with my stepfather, who is
the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the
Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; nodded his head. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The name is familiar to me,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and
Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive
heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin
was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.
Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the
two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy
mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the
horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my
stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,
obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a
medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional
skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a
fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been
perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and
narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term
of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and
disappointed man.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;When &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt; was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the
young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister
Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of
my mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less
than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt; entirely
while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum
should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly
after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years
ago in a railway accident near Crewe. &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt; then abandoned his
attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live
with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my
mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no
obstacle to our happiness.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,
who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in
the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came
out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his
path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in
the men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe,
been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,
until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would
fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and
absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,
and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather
together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no
friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these
vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land
which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the
hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for
weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent
over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and
a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
villagers almost as much as their master.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no
great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a
long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the
time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even
as mine has.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your sister is dead, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to
speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have
described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and
position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss
Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally
allowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at
Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to
whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when
my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within
a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the
terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed
and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and
glanced across at his visitor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray be precise as to details,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is
seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very
old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are
on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of
the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt;’s, the second
my sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between
them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself
plain?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Perfectly so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal
night &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt; had gone to his room early, though we knew that he
had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the
strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her
room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,
chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to
leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the
dead of the night?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘Never,’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your
sleep?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘Certainly not. But why?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the
morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has
awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next
room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you
whether you had heard it.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did
not hear it also.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at
me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the
lock.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in
at night?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Always.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And why?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a
baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune
impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you
know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely
allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain
was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the
hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified
woman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,
wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my
door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a
few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.
As I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved
slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing
what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I
saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her
hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that
of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She
writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully
convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I
bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never
forget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There
was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with
her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a
fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling
loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
dressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,
and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid
from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and
died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful
end of my beloved sister.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One moment,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;are you sure about this whistle and
metallic sound? Could you swear to it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my
strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale
and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was your sister dressed?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the
alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the
coroner come to?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;He investigated the case with great care, for &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt;’s conduct
had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any
satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been
fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by
old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every
night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite
solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with
the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large
staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when
she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon
her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How about poison?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;The doctors examined her for it, but without success.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though
what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Yes, there are nearly always some there.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled
band?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,
sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to
these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted
handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have
suggested the strange adjective which she used.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;These are very deep waters,&lt;/quote&gt; said he; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;pray go on with your
narrative.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately
lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have
known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in
marriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr.
Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no
opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the
spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the
building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to
move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very
bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last
night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly
heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the
herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was
to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,
so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a
dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,
from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing
you and asking your advice.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have done wisely,&lt;/quote&gt; said my friend. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But have you told me all?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Yes, all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Roylott&lt;/person&gt;, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Why, what do you mean?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For answer &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the
hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the
marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have been cruelly used,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. &lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;He is a
  hard man,&lt;/quote&gt; she said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a long silence, during which &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; leaned his chin upon his
hands and stared into the crackling fire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is a very deep business,&lt;/quote&gt; he said at last. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There are a thousand
details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course
of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to
Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms
without the knowledge of your stepfather?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most
important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and
that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,
but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;By no means.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in
town. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there
in time for your coming.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small
business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my
trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this
afternoon.&lt;/quote&gt; She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided
from the room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And what do you think of it all, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,
leaning back in his chair.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Dark enough and sinister enough.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are
sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her
sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious
end.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very
peculiar words of the dying woman?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot think.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a
band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the
fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an
interest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion
to a band, and, finally, the fact that &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Helen Stoner&lt;/person&gt; heard a
metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars
that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that
there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along
those lines.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But what, then, did the gipsies do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I cannot imagine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I see many objections to any such theory.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to
Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,
or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our
door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed
himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the
professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long
frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in
his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of
the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to
side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with
the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the
other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird
of prey.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Which of you is &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt; asked this apparition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,&lt;/quote&gt; said my companion
quietly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;I am &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby Roylott&lt;/person&gt;, of Stoke Moran.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; blandly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray take a seat.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have
traced her. What has she been saying to you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a little cold for the time of the year,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;What has she been saying to you?&lt;/quote&gt; screamed the old man furiously.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,&lt;/quote&gt; continued my
companion imperturbably.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Ha! You put me off, do you?&lt;/quote&gt; said our new visitor, taking a step
  forward and shaking his hunting-crop. &lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;I know you, you scoundrel! I
have heard of you before. You are &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, the meddler.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend smiled.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, the busybody!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His smile broadened.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; chuckled heartily. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your conversation is most entertaining,&lt;/quote&gt;
said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;When you go out close the door, for there is a decided
draught.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my
affairs. I know that &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt; has been here. I traced her! I am a
dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.&lt;/quote&gt; He stepped swiftly forward,
seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;See that you keep yourself out of my grip,&lt;/quote&gt; he snarled, and hurling
the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He seems a very amiable person,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am not
quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my
grip was not much more feeble than his own.&lt;/quote&gt; As he spoke he picked up
the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from
her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, we
shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’
Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this
matter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nearly one o’clock when &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; returned from his
excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over
with notes and figures.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have seen the will of the deceased wife,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;To determine its
exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the
investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the
time of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through
the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can
claim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,
therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a
mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very
serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has
proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way
of anything of the sort. And now, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, this is too serious for
dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting
ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and
drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your
revolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument
with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a
tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,
where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five
miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a
bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and
wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the
air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least
there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring
and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his
eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.
Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed
over the meadows.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Look there!&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into
a grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out
the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Stoke Moran?&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Yes, sir, that be the house of &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby Roylott&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked the
driver.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is some building going on there,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that is where we
are going.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;There’s the village,&lt;/quote&gt; said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs
some distance to the left; &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;but if you want to get to the house, you’ll
find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the
fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And the lady, I fancy, is &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; observed &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, shading his
eyes. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to
Leatherhead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I thought it as well,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as we climbed the stile, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that this
fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite
business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt;. You see
that we have been as good as our word.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
which spoke her joy. &lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I have been waiting so eagerly for you,&lt;/quote&gt; she
cried, shaking hands with us warmly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;All has turned out splendidly.
&lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt; has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back
before evening.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,&lt;/quote&gt; said
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss
Stoner&lt;/person&gt; turned white to the lips as she listened.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Good heavens!&lt;/quote&gt; she cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;he has followed me, then.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;So it appears.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will
he say when he returns?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more
cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him
to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at
Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us
at once to the rooms which we are to examine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central
portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on
each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked
with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of
ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the
right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the
windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that
this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected
against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but
there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep
attention the outsides of the windows.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the
centre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to
&lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt;’s chamber?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not
seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my
room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing
runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows
in it, of course?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable
from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room
and bar your shutters?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt; did so, and &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, after a careful examination through the
open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but
without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be
passed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but
they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hum!&lt;/quote&gt;
said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;my theory certainly
presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they
were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the
matter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the
three bedrooms opened. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; refused to examine the third chamber, so
we passed at once to the second, that in which &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt; was now
sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a
homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after
the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in
one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a
dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,
with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the
room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round
and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of
the house. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,
while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in
every detail of the apartment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Where does that bell communicate with?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked at last pointing to a
thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually
lying upon the pillow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;It goes to the housekeeper’s room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It looks newer than the other things?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your sister asked for it, I suppose?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
wanted for ourselves.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You
will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this
floor.&lt;/quote&gt; He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand
and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks
between the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which
the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent
some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.
Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Why, it’s a dummy,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Won’t it ring?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You
can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little
opening for the ventilator is.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;How very absurd! I never noticed that before.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very strange!&lt;/quote&gt; muttered &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, pulling at the rope. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There are one or
two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a
builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the
same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;That is also quite modern,&lt;/quote&gt; said the lady.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Done about the same time as the bell-rope?&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy
bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
permission, &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt;, we shall now carry our researches into the
inner apartment.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby Roylott&lt;/person&gt;’s chamber was larger than that of his
step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden
shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair
beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,
and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the
keenest interest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What’s in here?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked, tapping the safe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;My stepfather’s business papers.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh! you have seen inside, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There isn’t a cat in it, for example?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;No. What a strange idea!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, look at this!&lt;/quote&gt; He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on
the top of it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.
There is one point which I should wish to determine.&lt;/quote&gt; He squatted down
in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the
greatest attention.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you. That is quite settled,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, rising and putting his
lens in his pocket. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Hullo! Here is something interesting!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one
corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied
so as to make a loop of whipcord.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What do you make of that, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and
when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I
think that I have seen enough now, &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt;, and with your
permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was
when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked
several times up and down the lawn, neither &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt; nor myself
liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his
reverie.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is very essential, &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that you should
absolutely follow my advice in every respect.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I shall most certainly do so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend
upon your compliance.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I assure you that I am in your hands.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your
room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt; and I gazed at him in astonishment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village
inn over there?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Yes, that is the Crown.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Certainly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the
night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put
your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with
everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to
occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage
there for one night.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Oh, yes, easily.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The rest you will leave in our hands.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;But what will you do?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the
cause of this noise which has disturbed you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;I believe, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, that you have already made up your mind,&lt;/quote&gt; said
&lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt;, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Perhaps I have.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s
death.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Helen_Stoner"&gt;You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she
died from some sudden fright.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more
tangible cause. And now, &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt;, we must leave you for if &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr.
Roylott&lt;/person&gt; returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and
be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured
that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from
our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the
inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby
Roylott&lt;/person&gt; drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure
of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing
the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s
voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.
The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring
up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you know, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as we sat together in the gathering
darkness, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There
is a distinct element of danger.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Can I be of assistance?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your presence might be invaluable.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then I shall certainly come.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is very kind of you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than
was visible to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that
you saw all that I did.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that
could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You saw the ventilator, too?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a
small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could
hardly pass through.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke
Moran.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My dear &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister
could smell &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Roylott&lt;/person&gt;’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once
that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only
be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s
inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But what harm can there be in that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator
is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does
not that strike you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot as yet see any connection.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that
before?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot say that I have.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call
it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are
only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is
the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and
Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes
even deeper, but I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that we shall be able to strike
deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is
over; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds
for a few hours to something more cheerful.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all
was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly
away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright
light shone out right in front of us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is our signal,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, springing to his feet; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;it comes
from the middle window.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining
that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was
possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were
out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow
light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our
sombre errand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired
breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we
reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the
window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed
to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass
with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the
darkness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My God!&lt;/quote&gt; I whispered; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;did you see it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice
upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put
his lips to my ear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a nice household,&lt;/quote&gt; he murmured. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is the baboon.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a
cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any
moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the
bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp
onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had
seen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of
his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that
I could do to distinguish the words:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The least sound would be fatal to our plans.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded to show that I had heard.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol
ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and
you in that chair.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed
beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.
Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,
not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat
open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous
tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of
light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our
very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah
was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the
parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they
seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and
still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction
of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a
strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room
had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then
all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an
hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became
audible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of
steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
his cane at the bell-pull.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You see it, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt; he yelled. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You see it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I saw nothing. At the moment when &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; struck the light I heard a
low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes
made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed
so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and
filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing
up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the
night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled
up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all
mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood
gazing at &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died
away into the silence from which it rose.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What can it mean?&lt;/quote&gt; I gasped.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It means that it is all over,&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And perhaps, after
all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr.
Roylott&lt;/person&gt;’s room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then
he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked
pistol in my hand.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of
light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this
table, on the wooden chair, sat &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby Roylott&lt;/person&gt; clad in a long
grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet
thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short
stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin
was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at
the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow
band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round
his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The band! the speckled band!&lt;/quote&gt; whispered &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to
move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a swamp adder!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;the deadliest snake in India. He
has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,
recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he
digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we
can then remove &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt; to some place of shelter and let the county
police know what has happened.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and
throwing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid
perch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,
which he closed upon it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such are the true facts of the death of &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby Roylott&lt;/person&gt;, of Stoke
Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has
already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news
to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the
care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official
inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while
indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet
to learn of the case was told me by &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as we travelled
back next day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I had,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
shows, my dear &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, how dangerous it always is to reason from
insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word
‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the
appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of
her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I
can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position
when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an
occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.
My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to
this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the
floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as
a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.
The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it
with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of
creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.
The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be
discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a
clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity
with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point
of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who
could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of
course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to
the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we
saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this
ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it
would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not
bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
sooner or later she must fall a victim.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An
inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of
standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he
should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,
and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which
may have remained. The metallic clang heard by &lt;person perName="Helen_Stoner"&gt;Miss Stoner&lt;/person&gt; was
obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe
upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the
steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the
creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit
the light and attacked it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;With the result of driving it through the ventilator.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the
other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its
snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this
way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for &lt;person perName="Grimesby_Roylott"&gt;Dr. Grimesby Roylott&lt;/person&gt;’s
death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my
conscience.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="IX"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER’S THUMB&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr.
Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there
were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that
of &lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Mr. Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of
these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and
original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so
dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed
upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those
deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable
results. The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the
newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less
striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than
when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery
clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which
leads on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served
to weaken the effect.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the
events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to
civil practice and had finally abandoned &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; in his Baker Street
rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even
persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit
us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no
very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from
among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and
lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of
endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any
influence.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by the
maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from
Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed
hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom
trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the
guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I’ve got him here,&lt;/quote&gt; he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;
&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;he’s all right.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What is it, then?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some
strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;It’s a new patient,&lt;/quote&gt; he whispered. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I thought I’d bring him round
myself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I
must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.&lt;/quote&gt; And off
he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.
He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap
which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a
handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He
was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,
masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression
of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took
all his strength of mind to control.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;but I have had
a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this
morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a
doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a
card, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took it up and glanced at it. "&lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Mr. Victor Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;, hydraulic
engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name, style,
and abode of my morning visitor. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I regret that I have kept you
waiting,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, sitting down in my library-chair. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You are fresh from
a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous
occupation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, and laughed. He
laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his
chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against
that laugh.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Stop it!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried; &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;pull yourself together!&lt;/quote&gt; and I poured out some
water from a caraffe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is
over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and
pale-looking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I have been making a fool of myself,&lt;/quote&gt; he gasped.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Not at all. Drink this.&lt;/quote&gt; I dashed some brandy into the water, and the
colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;That’s better!&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly
attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my
hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding
fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have
been. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Good heavens!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;this is a terrible injury. It must have bled
considerably.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have
been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was
still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round
the wrist and braced it up with a twig.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
province.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;This has been done,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, examining the wound, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;by a very heavy and
sharp instrument.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;A thing like a cleaver,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;An accident, I presume?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;By no means.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What! a murderous attack?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Very murderous indeed.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You horrify me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it
over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back without
wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How is that?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked when I had finished.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was
very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying
to your nerves.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,
between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this
wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for
it is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof
with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which
I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will
be done.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Ha!&lt;/quote&gt; cried I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you
desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my
friend, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, before you go to the official police.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Oh, I have heard of that fellow,&lt;/quote&gt; answered my visitor, &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;and I should
be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must
use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to
him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I should be immensely obliged to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a
little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
instant.&lt;/quote&gt; I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,
and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new
acquaintance to Baker Street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in
his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking
his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and
dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and
collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He received us in his
quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us
in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance
upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
brandy and water within his reach.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, &lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Mr.
Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely
at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up
your strength with a little stimulant.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Thank you,&lt;/quote&gt; said my patient, &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;but I have felt another man since the
doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the
cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I
shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,
and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor
detailed to us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;You must know,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing
alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer,
and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven
years that I was apprenticed to Venner &amp; Matheson, the well-known firm,
of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having also
come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death, I
determined to start in business for myself and took professional
chambers in Victoria Street.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business
a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two
years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is
absolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings
amount to £ 27 10_s_. Every day, from nine in the morning until four in
the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began
to sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at
all.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my
clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me
upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel
Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel
himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding
thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole
face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was
drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation
seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was
bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but
neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
thirty.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘&lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Mr. Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You have
been recommended to me, &lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Mr. Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;, as being a man who is not only
proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of
preserving a secret.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at
this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan
and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘That is quite correct,’ I answered; ‘but you will excuse me if I say
that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that
you wished to speak to me?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the
point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy
is quite essential—absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we
may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in
the bosom of his family.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend
upon my doing so.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had
never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Do you promise, then?’ said he at last.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Yes, I promise.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference
to the matter at all, either in word or writing?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I have already given you my word.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across
the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are
sometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in
safety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at
me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to
rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even my
dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my
impatience.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of
value.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to
my lips.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Most admirably.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I
simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has
got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it
right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Where to?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of
Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from
Paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Very good.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘There is a drive, then?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven
miles from Eyford Station.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would
be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense
you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and
unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of
your profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the
business, there is plenty of time to do so.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be
to me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate
myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little
more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have
exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to
commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I
suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Entirely.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
fuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one
or two places in England?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I have heard so.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small place—within
ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was
a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On examining it,
however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and
that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right
and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These
good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that
which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but
unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I took a few
of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we
should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in
this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the
neighbouring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and in
order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This
press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish
your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,
however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers
coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if
the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise
me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford
to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not quite
understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in
excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like
gravel from a pit.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Ah!’ said he carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress the
earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they
are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my
confidence now, &lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Mr. Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;, and I have shown you how I trust you.’
He rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I shall certainly be there.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last long,
questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he
hurried from the room.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much
astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had
been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the
fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price
upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to
other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had
made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his
explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the
necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I
should tell anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the
winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,
having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the
little dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger
who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single
sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,
however, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow
upon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me
into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the
windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as
fast as the horse could go.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One horse?&lt;/quote&gt; interjected &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Yes, only one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Did you observe the colour?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
carriage. It was a chestnut.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Tired-looking or fresh?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Oh, fresh and glossy.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most
interesting statement.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander
Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from
the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it
must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the
time, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,
that he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem
to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and
jolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of
where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make
out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now and
then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but
the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon
flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for
the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a
stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,
pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We stepped,
as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I
failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The
instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily
behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about
looking for matches and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door
opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light
shot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a
lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face
forward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from
the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it
was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a
tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from
her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,
and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he
walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few
minutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,
plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which
several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp
on the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you
waiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of
German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the
others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,
hoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak
shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully
silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the
passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of
uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and
what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I
knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that
matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that
radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it was
quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the
country. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath
to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my
fifty-guinea fee.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter
stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was
standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the
yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I
could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a
chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be
silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her
eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom
behind her.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak
calmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you
to do.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot
possibly leave until I have seen the machine.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass
through the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and
shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step
forward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she
whispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage
in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my
fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night
which seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should
I slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the
payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a
monomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had
shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and
declared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew
her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several
footsteps was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw
up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as
noiselessly as she had come.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a
chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was
introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By the way, I
was under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear
that you have felt the draught.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself because I felt
the room to be a little close.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better
proceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you
up to see the machine.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Oh, no, it is in the house.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All
we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is
wrong with it.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat
manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with
corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,
the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had
crossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above
the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the
damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put
on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the
warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen
eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least
a fellow-countryman.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he
unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us
could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the
colonel ushered me in.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it
would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn
it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the
descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon
this metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside
which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the
manner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but
there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little
of its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to
show us how we can set it right.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.
It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous
pressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers
which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there
was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through
one of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the
india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk
so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was
clearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my
companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several
practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When
I had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was
obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest
fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an
engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of
wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came
to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I
had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I
heard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of
the colonel looking down at me.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that
which he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I
think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if
I knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my
speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey
eyes.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took
a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the
lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite
secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hullo!’
I yelled. ‘Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart
into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the
leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood
upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its
light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,
jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must
within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,
screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I
implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the
levers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my
head, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.
Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face the
weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that
dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve
to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which
brought a gush of hope back to my heart.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls
were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line
of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and
broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could
hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.
The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the
other side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the
lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,
told me how narrow had been my escape.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I
found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a
woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held
a candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had
so foolishly rejected.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Come! come!’ she cried breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.
They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious
time, but come!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my
feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The
latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard
the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering
the other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath. My
guide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit’s end.
Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window
of which the moon was shining brightly.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that
you can jump it.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing
forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s
cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the
window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden
looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet
down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I
should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who
pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to
go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my
mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw
her arms round him and tried to hold him back.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried in English, ‘remember your promise after the
last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he
will be silent!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.
‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’
He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with
his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to
the sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip
loosened, and I fell into the garden below.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood
that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I
ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my
hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw
that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my
wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a
sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among
the rose-bushes.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a
very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,
and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The
smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night’s
adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly
yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to
look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been
lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little
lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,
to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.
Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during
those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.
There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter was
on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him
whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was
strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for
me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was
one about three miles off.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to
wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It
was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound
dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I
put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this
extraordinary narrative. Then &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; pulled down from the
shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his
cuttings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Here is an advertisement which will interest you,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It
appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost, on
the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic
engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been
heard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the
last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I
fancy.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Good heavens!&lt;/quote&gt; cried my patient. &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Then that explains what the girl
said.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand
in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will
leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is
precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard
at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,
bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt;, of Scotland Yard,
a plain-clothes man, and myself. &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt; had spread an ordnance map
of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing
a circle with Eyford for its centre.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;There you are,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;That circle is drawn at a radius of ten
miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that
line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;It was an hour’s good drive.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were
unconscious?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been
lifted and conveyed somewhere.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What I cannot understand,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;is why they should have spared you
when they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain
was softened by the woman’s entreaties.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my
life.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Well, I have
drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk
that we are in search of are to be found.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think I could lay my finger on it,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; quietly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Really, now!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the inspector, &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;you have formed your opinion!
Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the
country is more deserted there.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;And I say east,&lt;/quote&gt; said my patient.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I am for west,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked the plain-clothes man. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;There are several
quiet little villages up there.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And I am for north,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;because there are no hills there, and
our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Come,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the inspector, laughing; &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;it’s a very pretty diversity of
opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your
casting vote to?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You are all wrong.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;But we can’t all be.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, yes, you can. This is my point.&lt;/quote&gt; He placed his finger in the
centre of the circle. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is where we shall find them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;But the twelve-mile drive?&lt;/quote&gt; gasped &lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse
was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had
gone twelve miles over heavy roads?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,&lt;/quote&gt; observed &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt; thoughtfully.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;None at all,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They are coiners on a large scale, and
have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of
silver.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,&lt;/quote&gt; said the
inspector. &lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We
even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they
had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old
hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got
them right enough.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined
to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we
saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small
clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich
feather over the landscape.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;A house on fire?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Bradstreet"&gt;Bradstreet&lt;/person&gt; as the train steamed off again on
its way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Yes, sir!&lt;/quote&gt; said the station-master.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;When did it break out?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and
the whole place is in a blaze.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Bradstreet"&gt;Whose house is it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Dr. Becher’s.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Tell me,&lt;/quote&gt; broke in the engineer, &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,
with a long, sharp nose?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station-master laughed heartily. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
Englishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined
waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I
understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good
Berkshire beef would do him no harm.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill, and
there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,
spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front
three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;That’s it!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Hatherley&lt;/person&gt;, in intense excitement. &lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;There is the
gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second
window is the one that I jumped from.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, at least,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;you have had your revenge upon them.
There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was
crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt
they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.
Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,
though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no
word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister
German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met
a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving
rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the
fugitives disappeared, and even &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ ingenuity failed ever to
discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which
they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed
human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,
however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the
flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been
reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and
iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our
unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin
were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,
which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have
been already referred to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the
spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a
mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain
tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom
had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the
whole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold
or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear
the unconscious man out of the way of danger.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Victor_Hatherley"&gt;Well,&lt;/quote&gt; said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once

thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Experience,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indirectly it may be of value,

&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; marriage, and its curious termination, have long
ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which
the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and
their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this
four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the
full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my
friend &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had a considerable share in clearing the matter
up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little
sketch of this remarkable episode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was
still sharing rooms with &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; in Baker Street, that he came home from
an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I
had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn
to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had
brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign
throbbed with dull persistence. With my body in one easy-chair and my
legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers
until at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all
aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble
correspondent could be.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Here is a very fashionable epistle,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked as he entered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Your
morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a
tide-waiter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,&lt;/quote&gt; he
answered, smiling, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;and the humbler are usually the more interesting.
This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
a man either to be bored or to lie.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Not social, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, distinctly professional.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And from a noble client?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;One of the highest in England.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My dear fellow, I congratulate you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I assure you, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, without affectation, that the status of my
client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.
It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this
new investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,
have you not?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It looks like it,&lt;/quote&gt; said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the
corner. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have had nothing else to do.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read
nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is
always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely
you must have read about &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; and his wedding?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St.
Simon&lt;/person&gt;. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these
papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he
says:
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘MY DEAR &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES&lt;/person&gt;,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may
place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have
determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in
reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding. &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, of Scotland Yard, is
acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it
might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in the
afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,
I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount
importance. Yours faithfully,
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘ROBERT ST. SIMON.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the
noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer
side of his right little finger,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; as he folded up the
epistle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the
subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order
of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.&lt;/quote&gt; He picked a
red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the
mantelpiece. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Here he is,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, sitting down and flattening it out
upon his knee. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;‘&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, second son
of the Duke of Balmoral.’ Hum! ‘Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief
over a fess sable. Born in 1846.’ He’s forty-one years of age, which is
mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late
administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for
Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and
Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive
in all this. I think that I must turn to you &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, for something more
solid.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;for
the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I
feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry
on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van.
That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from the
first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
column of the _Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back:
‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumour is
correct, very shortly take place, between &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord Robert St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, second
son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of
Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Terse and to the point,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, stretching his long, thin
legs towards the fire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of
the same week. Ah, here it is: ‘There will soon be a call for
protection in the marriage  market, for the present free-trade
principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one
the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the
hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important
addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes
which have been borne away by these charming invaders. &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;,
who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little
god’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage
with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California
millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face
attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only
child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. As
it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to
sell his pictures within the last few years, and as &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; has
no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is
obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an
alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition
from a Republican lady to a British peeress.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Anything else?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, yawning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the _Morning Post_ to
say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would
be at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate
friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the
furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius
Doran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt
announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon
would be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are
all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Before the what?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; with a start.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The vanishing of the lady.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;When did she vanish, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;At the wedding breakfast.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
dramatic, in fact.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the
honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.
Pray let me have the details.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I warn you that they are very incomplete.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Perhaps we may make them less so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning
paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular
Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;‘The family of &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord Robert St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; has been thrown into the greatest
consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken
place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly
announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;
but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange
rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the
attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention
has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by
affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,
was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the
bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,
Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister
of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party
proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster
Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little
trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who
endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,
alleging that she had some claim upon &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;. It was only after
a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and
the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before
this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,
when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.
Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed
her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber
for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the
passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the
house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his
mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that
his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the
police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will
probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.
Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the
whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumours of foul play in the
matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the
woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from
jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the
strange disappearance of the bride.’&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And is that all?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a
suggestive one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And it is—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;That &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Miss Flora Millar&lt;/person&gt;, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has
actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_
at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.
There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands
now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have
missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, and as
the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this
will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, for I
very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own
memory.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord Robert St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; announced our page-boy, throwing open the
door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed
and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with
the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever
been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet his
general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight
forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His hair,
too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the
edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the
verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white
waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured
gaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left
to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden
eyeglasses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Good-day, &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, rising and bowing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray take
the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Dr. Watson&lt;/person&gt;. Draw up
a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr.
Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have
already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I
presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, I am descending.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I beg pardon.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My last client of the sort was a king.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The King of Scandinavia.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;What! Had he lost his wife?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You can understand,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; suavely, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that I extend to the
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in
yours.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own
case, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in
forming an opinion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,
nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article, for
example, as to the disappearance of the bride.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; glanced over it. &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Yes, it is correct, as far as it
goes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer
an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by
questioning you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Pray do so.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;In San Francisco, a year ago.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You were travelling in the States?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Did you become engaged then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;No.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But you were on a friendly footing?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Her father is very rich?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And how did he make his money?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s
character?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the
fire. &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;You see, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;my wife was twenty before her
father became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining
camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has
come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She is what we call
in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by
any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I was about to say.
She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the name
which I have the honour to bear&lt;/quote&gt;—he gave a little stately cough—&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;had I
not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is
capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would
be repugnant to her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you her photograph?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I brought this with me.&lt;/quote&gt; He opened a locket and showed us the full
face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory
miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the
lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and
handed it back to &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
acquaintance?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met
her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait
accompli_?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I really have made no inquiries on the subject.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
wedding?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Was she in good spirits?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future
lives.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;She was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And did you observe any change in her then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever
seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however, was
too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray let us have it, for all that.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the
vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over
into the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the pew
handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for
the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me
abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly
agitated over this trifling cause.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the
general public were present, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I
think that we are wandering rather far from the point.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Lady_St_Simon"&gt;Lady St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful
frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering
her father’s house?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I saw her in conversation with her maid.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And who is her maid?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California with
her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;A confidential servant?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to
take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these
things in a different way.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;How long did she speak to this Alice?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You did not overhear what they said?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;&lt;person perName="Lady_St_Simon"&gt;Lady St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was
accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do
when she finished speaking to her maid?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;She walked into the breakfast-room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On your arm?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then,
after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,
muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came
back.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her
room, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,
and went out.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
company with &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Flora Millar&lt;/person&gt;, a woman who is now in custody, and who had
already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and
your relations to her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;We have
been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_
friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have not treated her
ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but
you know what women are, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Flora&lt;/person&gt; was a dear little thing, but
exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me
dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to
tell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly
was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came
to Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push
her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even
threatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the
sort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon
pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good
in making a row.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Did your wife hear all this?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;No, thank goodness, she did not.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Yes. That is what &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so
serious. It is thought that &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Flora&lt;/person&gt; decoyed my wife out and laid some
terrible trap for her.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, it is a possible supposition.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;You think so, too?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this
as likely?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I do not think &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Flora&lt;/person&gt; would hurt a fly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is
your own theory as to what took place?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have
given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it
has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the
consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the
effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will not
say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without
success—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,
smiling. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And now, &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, I think that I have nearly all my
data. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that
you could see out of the window?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;We could see the other side of the road and the Park.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I
shall communicate with you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,&lt;/quote&gt; said our
client, rising.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have solved it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Eh? What was that?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I say that I have solved it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Where, then, is my wife?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; shook his head. &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I am afraid that it will take wiser
heads than yours or mine,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, and bowing in a stately,
old-fashioned manner he departed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is very good of &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; to honour my head by putting it on a
level with his own,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that I
shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this
cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before
our client came into the room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;My dear &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked
before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn
my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally
very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote
Thoreau’s example.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But I have heard all that you have heard.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me
so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and
something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the
Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is
&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;! Good-afternoon, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;! You will find an extra tumbler upon
the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which
gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas
bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the
cigar which had been offered to him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What’s up, then?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; with a twinkle in his eye. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You look
dissatisfied.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.
I can make neither head nor tail of the business.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Really! You surprise me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And very wet it seems to have made you,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; laying his hand
upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;In Heaven’s name, what for?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;In search of the body of &lt;person perName="Lady_St_Simon"&gt;Lady St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Why? What do you mean?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one
as in the other.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; shot an angry glance at my companion. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I suppose you know all
about it,&lt;/quote&gt; he snarled.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the
matter?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think it very unlikely.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in
it?&lt;/quote&gt; He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a
wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a
bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;There,&lt;/quote&gt;
said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;There is
a little nut for you to crack, Master &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, indeed!&lt;/quote&gt; said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You
dragged them from the Serpentine?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They
have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the
clothes were there the body would not be far off.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in
the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive
at through this?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;At some evidence implicating &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Flora Millar&lt;/person&gt; in the disappearance.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am afraid that you will find it difficult.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Are you, indeed, now?&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; with some bitterness. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I am
afraid, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, that you are not very practical with your deductions
and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.
This dress does implicate &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Miss Flora Millar&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And how?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
card-case is a note. And here is the very note.&lt;/quote&gt; He slapped it down
upon the table in front of him. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Listen to this: ‘You will see me when
all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been
that &lt;person perName="Lady_St_Simon"&gt;Lady St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; was decoyed away by &lt;person perName="Flora_Millar"&gt;Flora Millar&lt;/person&gt;, and that she,
with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.
Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt
quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within
their reach.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very good, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, laughing. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You really are very fine
indeed. Let me see it.&lt;/quote&gt; He took up the paper in a listless way, but his
attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of
satisfaction. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This is indeed important,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Ha! you find it so?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;Why,&lt;/quote&gt; he
shrieked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;you’re looking at the wrong side!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On the contrary, this is the right side.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over
here.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,
which interests me deeply.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;‘Oct.
4th, rooms 8_s_., breakfast 2_s_. 6_d_., cocktail 1_s_., lunch 2_s_.
6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.’ I see nothing in that.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,
it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate
you again.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I’ve wasted time enough,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;, rising. &lt;quote spokeBy="Lestrade"&gt;I believe in hard
work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter
first.&lt;/quote&gt; He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made
for the door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just one hint to you, &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; drawled &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; before his rival
vanished; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I will tell you the true solution of the matter. &lt;person perName="Lady_St_Simon"&gt;Lady St.
Simon&lt;/person&gt; is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such
person.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his
forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had hardly shut the door behind him when &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; rose to put on his
overcoat. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor
work,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;so I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that I must leave you to your
papers for a little.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was after five o’clock when &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; left me, but I had no
time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s
man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a
youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great
astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out
upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of
cold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie with a group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my
two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with
no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered
to this address.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before nine o’clock &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; stepped briskly into the room.
His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which
made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They have laid the supper, then,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, rubbing his hands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am
surprised that &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that
I hear his step now upon the stairs.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My messenger reached you, then?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have
you good authority for what you say?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The best possible.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;What will the Duke say,&lt;/quote&gt; he murmured, &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;when he hears that one of the
family has been subjected to such humiliation?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
humiliation.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady
could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was
undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise
her at such a crisis.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;It was a slight, sir, a public slight,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, tapping
his fingers upon the table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented
a position.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been
shamefully used.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that I heard a ring,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, there are steps on
the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the
matter, &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, I have brought an advocate here who may be more
successful.&lt;/quote&gt; He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.
&lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Francis Hay Moulton&lt;/person&gt;. The lady, I think, you have already met.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and
stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the
breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had
taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he
still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,
perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;You’re angry, &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Robert&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said she. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;Well, I guess you have every cause
to be.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Pray make no apology to me,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; bitterly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should
have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from
the time when I saw &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; here again I just didn’t know what I was
doing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right
there before the altar.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Perhaps, &lt;person perName="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;Mrs. Moulton&lt;/person&gt;, you would like my friend and me to leave the
room while you explain this matter?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Francis_Moulton"&gt;If I may give an opinion,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked the strange gentleman, &lt;quote spokeBy="Francis_Moulton"&gt;we’ve had
just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,
I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.&lt;/quote&gt; He was
a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert
manner.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;Then I’ll tell our story right away,&lt;/quote&gt; said the lady. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;&lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; here and I
met in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a
claim. We were engaged to each other, &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; and I; but then one day
father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; here had
a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the
poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting
any longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; wouldn’t throw up his
hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing
anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
fixed it all up for ourselves. &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; said that he would go and make his
pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.
So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged
myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t we be
married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of you;
and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we
talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman
all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank
went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;The next I heard of &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; was that he was in Montana, and then he went
prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After
that came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been
attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the
killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa
thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco. Not
a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that
&lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; was really dead. Then &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; came to ’Frisco, and we came
to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I
felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;Still, if I had married &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, of course I’d have done my
duty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went
to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a
wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just
as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; standing and
looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at
first; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of
question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to
see him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning
round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee
in my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know
what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to
be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that
he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped
my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he
returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when
he made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment
that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever
he might direct.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and
had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a
few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken to
&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt;, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all
those great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain
afterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank
out of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me and
then began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and
followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St.
Simon&lt;/person&gt; to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from
her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and away we
drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my
true wedding after all those years of waiting. &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; had been a
prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that
I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,
and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Francis_Moulton"&gt;I saw it in a paper,&lt;/quote&gt; explained the American. &lt;quote spokeBy="Francis_Moulton"&gt;It gave the name and
the church but not where the lady lived.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; was all for
openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should
like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line
to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to
think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table
and waiting for me to come back. So &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; took my wedding-clothes and
things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and
dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely
that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
gentleman, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, came round to us this evening, though how he
found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and
kindly that I was wrong and that &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Frank&lt;/person&gt; was right, and that we should be
putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to
give us a chance of talking to &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; alone, and so we came
right away round to his rooms at once. Now, &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Robert&lt;/person&gt;, you have heard it
all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you
do not think very meanly of me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had
listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long
narrative.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Excuse me,&lt;/quote&gt; he said, &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;but it is not my custom to discuss my most
intimate personal affairs in this public manner.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Moulton"&gt;Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.&lt;/quote&gt; He put out his hand
and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I had hoped,&lt;/quote&gt; suggested &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that you would have joined us in a
friendly supper.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I think that there you ask a little too much,&lt;/quote&gt; responded his Lordship.
  &lt;quote spokeBy="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can
hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that with your
permission I will now wish you all a very good-night.&lt;/quote&gt; He included us
all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,&lt;/quote&gt; said
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is always a joy to meet an American, &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Mr. Moulton&lt;/person&gt;,
for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the
blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our
children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country
under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the
Stars and Stripes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;The case has been an interesting one,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; when our
visitors had left us, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems
to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the
sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than
the result when viewed, for instance, by &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Mr. Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; of Scotland
Yard.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You were not yourself at fault at all, then?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the
lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other
that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.
Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her
to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have
spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of
the bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be
someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this
country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an
influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to
change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.
Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much
influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her
young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under
strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St.
Simon&lt;/person&gt;’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in
the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as
the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and
of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’
parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a
prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous
husband—the chances being in favour of the latter.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And how in the world did you find them?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It might have been difficult, but friend &lt;person perName="Lestrade"&gt;Lestrade&lt;/person&gt; held information in
his hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials
were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was
it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the
most select London hotels.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How did you deduce the select?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a
glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are
not many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which I
visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the
book that &lt;person perName="Francis_Moulton"&gt;Francis H. Moulton&lt;/person&gt;, an American gentleman, had left only the
day before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon
the very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were
to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being
fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give
them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position a little
clearer both to the general public and to &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; in particular.
I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the
appointment.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;But with no very good result,&lt;/quote&gt; I remarked. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;His conduct was certainly
not very gracious.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, smiling, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;perhaps you would not be very
gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you
found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think
that we may judge &lt;person perName="Robert_St_Simon"&gt;Lord St. Simon&lt;/person&gt; very mercifully and thank our stars
that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw
your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still
to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="XI"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down
the street, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that
his relatives should allow him to come out alone.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the
pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a
bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still
lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down
the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly
band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of
the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. The grey pavement
had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so
that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction
of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed
in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat
brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were
in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was
running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives
who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he
jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face
into the most extraordinary contortions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What on earth can be the matter with him?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;He is looking up
at the numbers of the houses.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I believe that he is coming here,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, rubbing his hands.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Here?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think
that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?&lt;/quote&gt; As he spoke,
the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell
until the whole house resounded with the clanging.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his
eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For
a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked
at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his
reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against
the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away
to the centre of the room. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; pushed him down into the
easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with
him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You
are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered
yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little
problem which you may submit to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against
his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his
lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;No doubt you think me mad?&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I see that you have had some great trouble,&lt;/quote&gt; responded &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so
sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,
although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.
Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming
together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very
soul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may
suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray compose yourself, sir,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;and let me have a clear
account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;My name,&lt;/quote&gt; answered our visitor, &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;is probably familiar to your ears. I
am &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Alexander Holder&lt;/person&gt;, of the banking firm of Holder &amp; Stevenson, of
Threadneedle Street.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner
in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.
What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens
of London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until
with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I feel that time is of value,&lt;/quote&gt; said he; &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;that is why I hastened here
when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your
co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried
from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That is
why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little
exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as
shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the
number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out
money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We
have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and
there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon
the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card
was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the
name, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I
had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household
word all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names
in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he
entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air
of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘&lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit
of advancing money.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘The firm does so when the security is good.’ I answered.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have £
50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times
over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business
and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily
understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under obligations.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it
right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should
be paid at once.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own
private purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather
more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the
name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,
even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square,
black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have
doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he
had named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the
price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would
put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am
prepared to leave it with you as my security.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity
from it to my illustrious client.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Not at all. I only doubt—’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about
that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain
that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter
of form. Is the security sufficient?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Ample.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You understand, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;, that I am giving you a strong proof of
the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard
of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all
gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with
every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public
scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it
would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no
beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to
replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and
I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes.
When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon
the table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of
the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no
doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would
ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having
ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once
more to my work.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so
precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been
forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible
would be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,
therefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case
backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of
my reach. With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house
at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe freely
until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my
dressing-room.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;And now a word as to my household, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, for I wish you to
thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of
the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants
who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability
is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,
has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent
character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very
pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about
the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will
not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an only son,
&lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;. He has been a disappointment to me, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;—a grievous
disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell
me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died
I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile
fade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.
Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,
but I meant it for the best.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,
to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums
of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,
and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a
number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play
heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again
and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than
once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but
each time the influence of his friend, &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George Burnwell&lt;/person&gt;, was enough
to draw him back again.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George Burnwell&lt;/person&gt;
should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to
my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the
fascination of his manner. He is older than &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;, a man of the world
to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a
brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think
of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am
convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in
his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,
and so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight
into character.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when
my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I
adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is
a sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and
housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.
She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In
only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has
asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she
has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the
right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have
changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—forever too late!
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Now, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, you know the people who live under my roof, and I
shall continue with my miserable story.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
dinner, I told &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; and Mary my experience, and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my
client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left
the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. &lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Mary&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;
were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I
thought it better not to disturb it.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Where have you put it?’ asked &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘In my own bureau.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the
night.’ said he.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘It is locked up,’ I answered.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have
opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what
he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very
grave face.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Look here, dad,’ said he with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me
have £ 200?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘No, I cannot!’ I answered sharply. ‘I have been far too generous with
you in money matters.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You have been very kind,’ said he, ‘but I must have this money, or
else I can never show my face inside the club again.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,’ said he.
‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and
if you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You
shall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried, on which he bowed and left
the room without another word.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was
safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see
that all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I
thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs
I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and
fastened as I approached.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did
you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Certainly not.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has
only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is
hardly safe and should be stopped.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are
you sure that everything is fastened?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Quite sure, dad.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,
where I was soon asleep.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I am endeavouring to tell you everything, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, which may have
any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any
point which I do not make clear.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my
mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in
the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had
ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as
though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all
my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of
footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all
palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room
door.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘&lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that
coronet?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed
only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding
the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending
it with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and
turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the
gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have
destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels
which you have stolen?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Stolen!’ he cried.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Yes, thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you
a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another
piece?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You have called me names enough,’ said he, ‘I will not stand it any
longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you
have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and
make my own way in the world.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried half-mad with
grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he with a passion such as I
should not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the
police, let the police find what they can.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in
my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of
the coronet and of &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;’s face, she read the whole story and, with a
scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the housemaid for the
police and put the investigation into their hands at once. When the
inspector and a constable entered the house, &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;, who had stood
sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to
charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
national property. I was determined that the law should have its way in
everything.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would
be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for
five minutes.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have
stolen,’ said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I
was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that
of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened
to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it
all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing
stones.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in
the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you
but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the
beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning
away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words
of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in the
inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only
of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where
he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could
be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our
persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and
I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round
to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The
police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of
it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already
offered a reward of £ 1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my
honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,
droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted
and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you receive much company?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
&lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;’s. &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George Burnwell&lt;/person&gt; has been several times lately. No one
else, I think.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you go out much in society?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;&lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is unusual in a young girl.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is
four-and-twenty.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her
also.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Terrible! She is even more affected than I.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in
his hands.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the
coronet at all injured?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Yes, it was twisted.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten
it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it
is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose
were innocent, why did he not say so?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His
silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular
points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which
awoke you from your sleep?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;They considered that it might be caused by &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;’s closing his
bedroom door.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as
to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of
these gems?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the
hope of finding them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have they thought of looking outside the house?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
already been minutely examined.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, my dear sir,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;is it not obvious to you now that
this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the
police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a
simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is
involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his
bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,
took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,
went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the
thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then
returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed
himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is
such a theory tenable?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;But what other is there?&lt;/quote&gt; cried the banker with a gesture of despair.
  &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is our task to find that out,&lt;/quote&gt; replied &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;so now, if you
please, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote
an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which
I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply
stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt
of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his
unhappy father, but still I had such faith in &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ judgment that I
felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was
dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the
whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his
breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.
Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of
hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence
of the great financier.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a
little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,
stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the
entrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into
a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the
kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a
lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at
all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; left us
standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind
into the stable lane. So long was he that &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt; and I went into
the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were
sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.
She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,
which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do
not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.
Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.
As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater
sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,
with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she
went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a
sweet womanly caress.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;You have given orders that &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; should be liberated, have you not,
dad?&lt;/quote&gt; she asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman’s instincts
are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for
having acted so harshly.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect
him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the
coronet in his hand?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my
word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more.
It is so dreadful to think of our dear &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; in prison!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, &lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Mary&lt;/person&gt;! Your
affection for &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far
from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London
to inquire more deeply into it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;This gentleman?&lt;/quote&gt; she asked, facing round to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the
stable lane now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;The stable lane?&lt;/quote&gt; She raised her dark eyebrows. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;What can he hope to
find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will
succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin
&lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; is innocent of this crime.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove
it,&lt;/quote&gt; returned &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his
shoes. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I believe I have the honour of addressing &lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Miss Mary Holder&lt;/person&gt;.
Might I ask you a question or two?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You heard nothing yourself last night?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and
I came down.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all
the windows?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Were they all fastened this morning?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to
your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may
have heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,
and that the two may have planned the robbery.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;But what is the good of all these vague theories,&lt;/quote&gt; cried the banker
  impatiently, &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;when I have told you that I saw &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; with the coronet
in his hands?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Wait a little, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;. We must come back to that. About this girl,
&lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Miss Holder&lt;/person&gt;. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met
her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you know him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. His
name is Francis Prosper.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He stood,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;to the left of the door—that is to say,
farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Yes, he did.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And he is a man with a wooden leg?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black
eyes. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;Why, you are like a magician,&lt;/quote&gt; said she. &lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;How do you know that?&lt;/quote&gt;
She smiled, but there was no answering smile in &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ thin, eager
face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I should be very glad now to go upstairs,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I shall probably
wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better
take a look at the lower windows before I go up.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the
large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he
opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his
powerful magnifying lens. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now we shall go upstairs,&lt;/quote&gt; said he at last.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with
a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; went to the
bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Which key was used to open it?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the
lumber-room.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you it here?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;That is it on the dressing-table.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; took it up and opened the bureau.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is a noiseless lock,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is no wonder that it did not
wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a
look at it.&lt;/quote&gt; He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it
upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,
and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one
side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three
gems had been torn away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;here is the corner which corresponds
to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will
break it off.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banker recoiled in horror. &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I should not dream of trying,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then I will.&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without
result. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I feel it give a little,&lt;/quote&gt; said he; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;but, though I am
exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to
break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would
happen if I did break it, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;? There would be a noise like a
pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards
of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, &lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Miss
Holder&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mary_Holder"&gt;I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck
during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not
succeed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;, I
shall now continue my investigations outside.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour
or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow
and his features as inscrutable as ever.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt;
said he; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;But the gems, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. Where are they?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I cannot tell.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The banker wrung his hands. &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I shall never see them again!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried.
  &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;And my son? You give me hopes?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My opinion is in no way altered.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in
my house last night?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning
between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it
clearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,
provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on
the sum I may draw.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I would give my fortune to have them back.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again
before evening.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about the
case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even
dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured
to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other
topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three
when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his
chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.
With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and
his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that this should do,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, glancing into the glass above
the fireplace. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I only wish that you could come with me, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, but I
fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may
be following a will-o’-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is. I
hope that I may be back in a few hours.&lt;/quote&gt; He cut a slice of beef from
the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of
bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon
his expedition.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent
spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it
down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I only looked in as I passed,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am going right on.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Where to?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I
get back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;How are you getting on?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since
I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet
little problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.
However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable
clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction
than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even
a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, and a
few minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that
he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I
retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for
days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his
lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,
but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a
cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim
as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You will excuse my beginning without you, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;but you
remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Why, it is after nine now,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I should not be surprised if
that were he. I thought I heard a ring.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change
which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad
and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed
to me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy
which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,
and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for
him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,&lt;/quote&gt; said he.
  &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in
the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow
comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, &lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Mary&lt;/person&gt;, has deserted
me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Deserted you?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,
and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last
night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all
might have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say
so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might
never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever
again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you
forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;
and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless
labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever
your loving,
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;‘&lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;MARY&lt;/person&gt;.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;What could she mean by that note, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;? Do you think it points
to suicide?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.
I trust, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Ha! You say so! You have heard something, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;; you have learned
something! Where are the gems?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I would pay ten.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And
there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your cheque-book? Here is a
pen. Better make it out for £ 4000.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; walked
over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three
gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;You have it!&lt;/quote&gt; he gasped. &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I am saved! I am saved!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he
hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There is one other thing you owe, &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;
rather sternly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Owe!&lt;/quote&gt; He caught up a pen. &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Name the sum, and I will pay it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble
lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be
proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Then it was not &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; who took them?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know
that the truth is known.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview
with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to
him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very
few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this
morning, however, may open his lips.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And
let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and
for you to hear: there has been an understanding between &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George
Burnwell&lt;/person&gt; and your niece &lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Mary&lt;/person&gt;. They have now fled together.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;My &lt;person perName="Mary_Holder"&gt;Mary&lt;/person&gt;? Impossible!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor
your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into
your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England—a
ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or
conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his
vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered
herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what
he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of
seeing him nearly every evening.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I cannot, and I will not, believe it!&lt;/quote&gt; cried the banker with an ashen
face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your
niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down
and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable
lane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he
stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold
kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that
she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover
extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.
She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about
one of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was
all perfectly true.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your boy, &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt;, went to bed after his interview with you but he
slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. In the
middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose
and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very
stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your
dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some
clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this
strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the
light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious
coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling
with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,
whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her
stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the
gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing
quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a
horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that she
was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,
and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as
he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,
and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the
moonlight. &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George Burnwell&lt;/person&gt; tried to get away, but &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; caught
him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one
side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,
your son struck &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George&lt;/person&gt; and cut him over the eye. Then something
suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his
hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had
just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was
endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Is it possible?&lt;/quote&gt; gasped the banker.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he
felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain the
true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved
little enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous
view, however, and preserved her secret.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,&lt;/quote&gt;
  cried &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr. Holder&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his
asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted
to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How
cruelly I have misjudged him!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;When I arrived at the house,&lt;/quote&gt; continued &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I at once went very
carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow
which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening
before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve
impressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all
trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the
far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,
whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I
could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run
back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel
marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I
thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of
whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I
passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random
tracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of
me.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double
line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was
at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your
son. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and
as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it
was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and
found they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow
away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where
the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,
where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not
mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge
of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to the
highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,
so there was an end to that clue.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill
and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see
that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an
instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then
beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man
had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed
had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled
with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength
causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had
returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his
opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and
who was it brought him the coronet?
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew
that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained
your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son
allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible
reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent
explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret
was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that
window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my
conjecture became a certainty.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for
who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to
you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends
was a very limited one. But among them was &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George Burnwell&lt;/person&gt;. I had
heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It
must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.
Even though he knew that &lt;person perName="Arthur_Holder"&gt;Arthur&lt;/person&gt; had discovered him, he might still
flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word
without compromising his own family.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I
went in the shape of a loafer to &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George&lt;/person&gt;’s house, managed to pick up
an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his
head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,
made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I
journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the
tracks.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Mr.
Holder&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and
changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,
for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I
knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the
matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.
But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to
bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,
however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.
Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece. That brought out the
first signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he,
‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get
the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there
would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I
got our stones at £ 1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told
him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock,
after what I may call a really hard day’s work.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,&lt;/quote&gt; said the
  banker, rising. &lt;quote spokeBy="Alexander_Holder"&gt;Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall
not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed
exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy
to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you
tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can
inform me where she is now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that we may safely say,&lt;/quote&gt; returned &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that she is
wherever &lt;person perName="George_Burnwell"&gt;Sir George Burnwell&lt;/person&gt; is. It is equally certain, too, that
whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient
punishment.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/story&gt;

&lt;story num="XII"&gt;
&lt;storyTitle&gt;THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES&lt;/storyTitle&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;To the man who loves art for its own sake,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,
tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;it is
frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the
keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,
&lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little
records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I
am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence
not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in
which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of
deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special
province.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;And yet,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, smiling, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I cannot quite hold myself absolved from
the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have erred, perhaps,&lt;/quote&gt; he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with
the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont
to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a
meditative mood—&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and
life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the
task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect
which is really the only notable feature about the thing.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,&lt;/quote&gt; I
remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I
had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s
singular character.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;No, it is not selfishness or conceit,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, answering, as was his
wont, my thoughts rather than my words. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;If I claim full justice for my
art, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.
Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather
than upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what
should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast
on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A
thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the
opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy
yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and
glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously
into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet
temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;At the same time,&lt;/quote&gt; he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat
puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;you can hardly
be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you
have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not
treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I
endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of
&lt;person perName="Mary_Sutherland"&gt;Miss Mary Sutherland&lt;/person&gt;, the problem connected with the man with the
twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters
which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational,
I fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;The end may have been so,&lt;/quote&gt; I answered, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;but the methods I hold to have
been novel and of interest.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by
his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!
But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of
the great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all
enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to
be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and
giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I
have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning
marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!&lt;/quote&gt; He tossed a crumpled letter
across to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran
thus:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"DEAR &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;MR. HOLMES&lt;/person&gt;,—I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I
should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to
me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do
not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,"&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"&lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;VIOLET HUNTER&lt;/person&gt;."
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Do you know the young lady?&lt;/quote&gt; I asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Not I.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is half-past ten now.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember
that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim
at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this
case, also.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for
here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was
plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a
plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own
way to make in the world.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,&lt;/quote&gt; said she, as my
companion rose to greet her, &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;but I have had a very strange experience,
and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask
advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what
I should do.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray take a seat, &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;. I shall be happy to do anything that I
can to serve you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see that &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was favourably impressed by the manner and
speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,
and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips
together, to listen to her story.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I have been a governess for five years,&lt;/quote&gt; said she, &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;in the family of
Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an
appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to
America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I
advertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last
the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my
wit’s end as to what I should do.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called
Westaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see
whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the
name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by &lt;person perName="Miss_Stoper"&gt;Miss
Stoper&lt;/person&gt;. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are
seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by
one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything
which would suit them.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as
usual, but I found that &lt;person perName="Miss_Stoper"&gt;Miss Stoper&lt;/person&gt; was not alone. A prodigiously stout
man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down
in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of
glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.
As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to
&lt;person perName="Miss_Stoper"&gt;Miss Stoper&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better.
Capital! capital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands
together in the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking
man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Yes, sir.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘As governess?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Yes, sir.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘And what salary do you ask?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘I had £ 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat
hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How
could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and
accomplishments?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A
little French, a little German, music, and drawing—’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The
point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a
lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted
for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in
the history of the country. But if you have why, then, how could any
gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three
figures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £ 100 a year.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;You may imagine, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, that to me, destitute as I was, such an
offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing
perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and
took out a note.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion
until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white
creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary
beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey
and their wardrobe.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful
a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a
great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the
whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I
quite committed myself.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on
the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear
young lady, and the dearest old country-house.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could
see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three
gone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed
his eyes into his head again.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but
the father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single
child?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried.
‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to
obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they
were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no
difficulty, heh?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you
know—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which
we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Oh, no.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, my
hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.
It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in
this offhand fashion.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been
watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow
pass over his face as I spoke.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little
fancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’
fancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered firmly.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,
because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In
that case, &lt;person perName="Miss_Stoper"&gt;Miss Stoper&lt;/person&gt;, I had best inspect a few more of your young
ladies.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a
word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance
upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a
handsome commission through my refusal.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘If you please, &lt;person perName="Miss_Stoper"&gt;Miss Stoper&lt;/person&gt;.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most
excellent offers in this fashion,’ said she sharply. ‘You can hardly
expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.
Good-day to you, &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I
was shown out by the page.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Well, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, when I got back to my lodgings and found little
enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began
to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,
if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most
extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their
eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £ 100 a year.
Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by
wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I
was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I
was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to
the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received
this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read
it to you:
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘DEAR &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;MISS HUNTER&lt;/person&gt;,—&lt;person perName="Miss_Stoper"&gt;Miss Stoper&lt;/person&gt; has very kindly given me your
address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should
come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. We
are willing to give £ 30 a quarter, or £ 120 a year, so as to
recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may
cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond
of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear
such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to
the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear
daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think,
fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing
yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no
inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,
especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our
short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this
point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you
for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are
very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the
dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘&lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;JEPHRO RUCASTLE&lt;/person&gt;.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;That is the letter which I have just received, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and my mind
is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before
taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your
consideration.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;, if your mind is made up, that settles the
question,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, smiling.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;But you would not advise me to refuse?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a
sister of mine apply for.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;What is the meaning of it all, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed
some opinion?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;
seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his
wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear
she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in
every way in order to prevent an outbreak?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most
probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household
for a young lady.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;But the money, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, the money!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes me
uneasy. Why should they give you £ 120 a year, when they could have
their pick for £ 40? There must be some strong reason behind.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand
afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I
felt that you were at the back of me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your
little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my
way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of
the features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Danger! What danger do you foresee?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; shook his head gravely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It would cease to be a danger if we
could define it,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But at any time, day or night, a telegram
would bring me down to your help.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;That is enough.&lt;/quote&gt; She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all
  swept from her face. &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my
mind now. I shall write to &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; at once, sacrifice my poor hair
to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.&lt;/quote&gt; With a few grateful
words to &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her
way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;At least,&lt;/quote&gt; said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the
stairs, &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take
care of herself.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And she would need to be,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; gravely. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am much mistaken if
we do not hear from her before many days are past.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A
fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning
in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human
experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the
curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something
abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a
philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to
determine. As to &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, I observed that he sat frequently for half an
hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the
matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Data! data!
data!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried impatiently. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I can’t make bricks without clay.&lt;/quote&gt; And
yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should
ever have accepted such a situation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I
was thinking of turning in and &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; was settling down to one of those
all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I
would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and
find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the
morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the
message, threw it across to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, and turned back to his
chemical studies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summons was a brief and urgent one.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,"
it said. "Do come! I am at my wit’s end."
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"&lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;HUNTER&lt;/person&gt;."
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Will you come with me?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, glancing up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I should wish to.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Just look it up, then.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;There is a train at half-past nine,&lt;/quote&gt; said I, glancing over my
Bradshaw. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;It is due at Winchester at 11:30.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
morning.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old
English capital. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; had been buried in the morning papers all the
way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them
down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a
light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across
from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was
an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.
All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,
the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from
amid the light green of the new foliage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Are they not fresh and beautiful?&lt;/quote&gt; I cried with all the enthusiasm of
a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; shook his head gravely.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Do you know, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;that it is one of the curses of a mind
with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to
my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are
impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which
comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with
which crime may be committed there.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Good heavens!&lt;/quote&gt; I cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;Who would associate crime with these dear old
homesteads?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;,
founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London
do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and
beautiful countryside.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;You horrify me!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do
in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile
that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s blow,
does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then
the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of
complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime
and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,
filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the
law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which
may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had
this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country
which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally
threatened.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Quite so. She has her freedom.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover
the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can
only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt
find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we
shall soon learn all that &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt; has to tell.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance
from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. She
had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I am so delighted that you have come,&lt;/quote&gt; she said earnestly. &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;It is so
very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your
advice will be altogether invaluable to me.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray tell us what has happened to you.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; to
be back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,
though he little knew for what purpose.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Let us have everything in its due order.&lt;/quote&gt; &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; thrust his long thin
legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no
actual ill-treatment from Mr. and &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;. It is only fair to
them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my
mind about them.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;What can you not understand?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it
occurred. When I came down, &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; met me here and drove me in
his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully
situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square
block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp
and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and
on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton highroad,
which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This
ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part
of Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately
in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was
introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no
truth, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable
in your rooms at Baker Street. &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; is not mad. I found her to
be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more
than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than
forty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been
married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only
child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.
&lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; told me in private that the reason why she had left them
was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the
daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that
her position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;&lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in
feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. She was a
nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to
her husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered
continually from one to the other, noting every little want and
forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,
boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.
And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost
in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I
have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the
disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never
met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is
small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage
fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any
creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and
he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,
little birds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the
creature, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am glad of all details,&lt;/quote&gt; remarked my friend, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;whether they seem to
you to be relevant or not.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant
thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and
conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.
Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled
hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have
been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; seemed to
take no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a
sour face, as silent as &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; and much less amiable. They are a
most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of
the building.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very
quiet; on the third, &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; came down just after breakfast and
whispered something to her husband.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Oh, yes,’ said he, turning to me, ‘we are very much obliged to you,
&lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.
I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your
appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become
you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you
would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of
blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore
unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a
better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;
expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated
in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which
is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,
with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been
placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In
this I was asked to sit, and then &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;, walking up and down on
the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he
was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;, however, who
has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with
her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an
hour or so, &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; suddenly remarked that it was time to commence
the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to
little Edward in the nursery.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly
similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the
window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which
my employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.
Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little
sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me
to read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the
heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he
ordered me to cease and to change my dress.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;You can easily imagine, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, how curious I became as to what
the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They
were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the
window, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going
on behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon
devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought
seized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On
the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief
up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that
there was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was
nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,
however, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton
Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually
people there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings which
bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my
handkerchief and glanced at &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; to find her eyes fixed upon
me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced
that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what
was behind me. She rose at once.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road
there who stares up at &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘No friend of yours, &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;?’ he asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘No, I know no one in these parts.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to
go away.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round
and wave him away like that.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I did as I was told, and at the same instant &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; drew down
the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again
in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the
road.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Pray continue,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Your narrative promises to be a most
interesting one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to
be little relation between the different incidents of which I speak. On
the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; took
me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we
approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as
of a large animal moving about.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Look in here!’ said &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;, showing me a slit between two
planks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague
figure huddled up in the darkness.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I
had given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really
old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We
feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as
keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the
trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you
ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it’s
as much as your life is worth.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look
out of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a
beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was
silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the
peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was
moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the
moonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,
tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting
bones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow
upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart
which I do not think that any burglar could have done.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you
know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at
the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I
began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by
rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in
the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I
had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack
away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.
It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I
took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key
fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one
thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It
was my coil of hair.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and
the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded
itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With
trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew
from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I
assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle
as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned
the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the
Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a
drawer which they had locked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and I
soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was
one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door
which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into
this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I
ascended the stair, I met &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; coming out through this door,
his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very
different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His
cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins
stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried
past me without a word or a look.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could
see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a
row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered
up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,
glancing at them occasionally, &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; came out to me, looking as
merry and jovial as ever.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a
word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By the way,’ said I, ‘you seem
to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the
shutters up.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my
remark.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room
up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.
Who would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke
in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at
me. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Well, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, from the moment that I understood that there was
something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all
on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my
share of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good
might come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s
instinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.
At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any
chance to pass the forbidden door.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
besides &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;, both Toller and his wife find something to do in
these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen
bag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and
yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was
the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.
Mr. and &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; were both downstairs, and the child was with
them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently
in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,
which turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner
were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.
They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows
in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening
light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and
across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an
iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at
the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the
key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a
skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage
gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I
suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass
backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone
out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the
sight, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I
turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me
clutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through
the door, and straight into the arms of &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;, who was waiting
outside.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be
when I saw the door open.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how
caressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my
dear young lady?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was
keenly on my guard against him.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it
is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran
out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘I am sure that I do not know.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He
was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘I am sure if I had known—’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that
threshold again’—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of
rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw you
to the mastiff.’
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I
must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I
found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,
&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was
frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,
even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring
you down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,
but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon
made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down
to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind
as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered
that Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that
evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had
any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him
free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at
the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come
into Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,
for Mr. and &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; are going on a visit, and will be away all
the evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
all my adventures, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and I should be very glad if you could
tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My
friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his
pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Is Toller still drunk?&lt;/quote&gt; he asked.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Yes. I heard his wife tell &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; that she could do nothing
with him.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Yes.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Yes, the wine-cellar.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave
and sensible girl, &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;. Do you think that you could perform one
more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite
exceptional woman.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I will try. What is it?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I.
The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be
incapable. There only remains &lt;person perName="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Mrs. Toller&lt;/person&gt;, who might give the alarm. If
you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the
key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I will do it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course
there is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to
personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.
That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is
the daughter, &lt;person perName="Alice_Rucastle"&gt;Miss Alice Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;, if I remember right, who was said to
have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in
height, figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off,
very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came
upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of
hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress
and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he
saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that &lt;person perName="Alice_Rucastle"&gt;Miss Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; was
perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog
is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate
with her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case
is the disposition of the child.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;What on earth has that to do with it?&lt;/quote&gt; I ejaculated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;My dear &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as
to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see
that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first
real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.
This child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s
sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should
suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in
their power.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;I am sure that you are right, &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Mr. Holmes&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; cried our client. &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;A
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit
it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor
creature.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We
can do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,
and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the
Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. The
group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in
the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even
had &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt; not been standing smiling on the door-step.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Have you managed it?&lt;/quote&gt; asked &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;That is Mrs.
  Toller in the cellar,&lt;/quote&gt; said she. &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Her husband lies snoring on the
kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr.
Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;’s.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You have done well indeed!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; with enthusiasm. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Now lead
the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,
and found ourselves in front of the barricade which &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt; had
described. &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he
tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came
from within, and at the silence &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;’ face clouded over.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I trust that we are not too late,&lt;/quote&gt; said he. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think, &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;,
that we had better go in without you. Now, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, put your shoulder to
it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.
Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no furniture
save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The
skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;There has been some villainy here,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;; &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;this beauty has
guessed &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;’s intentions and has carried his victim off.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;But how?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.&lt;/quote&gt; He swung
himself up onto the roof. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah, yes,&lt;/quote&gt; he cried, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;here’s the end of a
long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;But it is impossible,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;; &lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;the ladder was not there
when the Rucastles went away.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he
whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that it would be
as well for you to have your pistol ready.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the
door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his
hand. &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt; screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of
him, but &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/person&gt; sprang forward and confronted him.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;You villain!&lt;/quote&gt; said he, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;where’s your daughter?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;It is for me to ask you that,&lt;/quote&gt; he shrieked, &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;you thieves! Spies and
thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve
you!&lt;/quote&gt; He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;He’s gone for the dog!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="John_Watson"&gt;I have my revolver,&lt;/quote&gt; said I.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Better close the front door,&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, and we all rushed down the
stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the
baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying
sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red
face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;My God!&lt;/quote&gt; he cried. &lt;quote spokeBy="Unknown"&gt;Someone has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for
two days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt; and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller
hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle
buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the
ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its
keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With
much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly
mangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and
having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I
did what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him
when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Violet_Hunter"&gt;&lt;person perName="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Mrs. Toller&lt;/person&gt;!&lt;/quote&gt; cried &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Yes, miss. &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; let me out when he came back before he went up
to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were
planning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ha!&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, looking keenly at her. &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;It is clear that &lt;person perName="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Mrs. Toller&lt;/person&gt;
knows more about this matter than anyone else.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points
on which I must confess that I am still in the dark.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;I will soon make it clear to you,&lt;/quote&gt; said she; &lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;and I’d have done so
before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s
police-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one
that stood your friend, and that I was &lt;person perName="Alice_Rucastle"&gt;Miss Alice&lt;/person&gt;’s friend too.
&lt;/quote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;She was never happy at home, &lt;person perName="Alice_Rucastle"&gt;Miss Alice&lt;/person&gt; wasn’t, from the time that her
father married again. She was slighted like and had no say in anything,
but it never really became bad for her until after she met &lt;person perName="Mr_Fowler"&gt;Mr. Fowler&lt;/person&gt;
at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, &lt;person perName="Alice_Rucastle"&gt;Miss Alice&lt;/person&gt; had rights of
her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she
never said a word about them but just left everything in &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;’s
hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a
husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give
him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her
to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her
money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got
brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door. Then she got better
at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but
that didn’t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as
true as man could be.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Ah,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I think that what you have been good enough to tell
us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that
remains. &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; then, I presume, took to this system of
imprisonment?&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Yes, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And brought &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt; down from London in order to get rid of the
disagreeable persistence of &lt;person perName="Mr_Fowler"&gt;Mr. Fowler&lt;/person&gt;.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;That was it, sir.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;But &lt;person perName="Mr_Fowler"&gt;Mr. Fowler&lt;/person&gt; being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,
blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,
metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the
same as his.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;&lt;person perName="Mr_Fowler"&gt;Mr. Fowler&lt;/person&gt; was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Mrs.
Toller&lt;/person&gt; serenely.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of
drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master
had gone out.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Mrs_Toller"&gt;You have it, sir, just as it happened.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;I am sure we owe you an apology, &lt;person perName="Mrs_Toller"&gt;Mrs. Toller&lt;/person&gt;,&lt;/quote&gt; said &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, &lt;quote spokeBy="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;for you
have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes
the country surgeon and &lt;person perName="Mrs_Rucastle"&gt;Mrs. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt;, so I think, &lt;person perName="John_Watson"&gt;Watson&lt;/person&gt;, that we had
best escort &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Hunter&lt;/person&gt; back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our
_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.&lt;/quote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper
beeches in front of the door. &lt;person perName="Jephro_Rucastle"&gt;Mr. Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; survived, but was always a
broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.
They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of
Rucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. &lt;person perName="Mr_Fowler"&gt;Mr.
Fowler&lt;/person&gt; and &lt;person perName="Alice_Rucastle"&gt;Miss Rucastle&lt;/person&gt; were married, by special license, in
Southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a
government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to &lt;person perName="Violet_Hunter"&gt;Miss Violet&lt;/person&gt;
Hunter, my friend &lt;person perName="Sherlock_Holmes"&gt;Holmes&lt;/person&gt;, rather to my disappointment, manifested no
further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of
one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/story&gt;
